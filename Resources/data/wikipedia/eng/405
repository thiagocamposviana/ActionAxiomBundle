["Pedro Celestino Silva Soares (born 2 January 1987), known as Celestino, is a Cape Verdean professional footballer who plays for G.D. Fabril as a central midfielder.","He also held a Portuguese passport, due to the many years spent in the country.","Born in Tarrafal, Celestino spent six years at Sporting CP (youth levels comprised), but never appeared officially for the first team. He spent his first season as a professional with C.D. Olivais e Moscavide, on loan, being relegated from the second division.","For 2007\u201308, in the same situation, Celestino joined G.D.

He met the same fate with his following club, C.F. Os Belenenses, but only due to sporting factors this time.","On 16 August 2011, Celestino signed with CFR Cluj in Romania, signing a three-year contract.[5] He returned to Portugal subsequently, going on to represent S.C. Olhanense[6] and Atl\u00e9tico Clube de Portugal.","On 7 February 2019, Celestino agreed to a deal at FC Farul Constan\u021ba, moving to the Liga II side alongside compatriots Jo\u00e3o Diogo and Diogo Rosado.[7]","Celestino earned seven caps for the Portugal under-21 team.
