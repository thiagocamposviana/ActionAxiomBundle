["HD 40307 e is an extrasolar planet orbiting the star HD 40307. It is located 42 light-years away in the direction of the southern constellation Pictor. The planet was discovered by the radial velocity method, using the European Southern Observatory's HARPS apparatus[1][2][3]  by a team of astronomers led by Mikko Tuomi at the University of Hertfordshire and Guillem Anglada-Escude of the University of G\u00f6ttingen, Germany.[4]","Its minimum mass is 3.5 that of Earth - the smallest - and dynamical models suggest it cannot be much more (and so is measured close to edge-on).[1] It further gets roughly the same insolation from its star as Mercury gets from the Sun.[5] Planets like this in that system have been presumed \"super-Earth\".[6]","However planets b, c, and d are presumed to have migrated in from outer orbits; and planet b is predicted a sub-Neptune.[7] It is likely that this planet formed even further out. Whether it is a sub-Neptune, a super-Venus or even a super-Mercury is unknown.","This extrasolar-planet-related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it."]
