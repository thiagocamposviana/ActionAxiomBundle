["Meix-le-Tige (Walloon M\u00e9ch-li-T\u00eexhe, Luxemburgish D\u00e4isch-Mier[1]\/D\u00e4itsch-Meesch, German Deutsche Meer) is a section of the Belgian town of Saint-L\u00e9ger, located in Wallonia municipality in the province of Luxembourg of Belgium.","It was a separate municipality before the merger of Commons in 1977.","Meix-le-Tige is an exception in Belgian Lorraine, in that its name belongs to the Germanic languages, while its inhabitants traditionally spoke Gaume (Lorraine dialect novel).","The explanation comes from the great plagues of the Middle Ages, when the Frankish population was completely decimated.","The village was then re-populated by Gaumais, who have not changed the name of the village.","This Belgian Luxembourg location article is a stub.
