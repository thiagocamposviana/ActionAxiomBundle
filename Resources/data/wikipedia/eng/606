["Risalah Arabic (\u0631\u0633\u0640\u0627\u0644\u0640\u0629) is the Arabic word for a treatise or philosophical prose within Islam. In Tayyibi Isma'ilism, Ras\u0101\u02beil Rama\u1e0d\u0101niyya refers to the works composed by the Da'i al-Mutlaq, during the month of Ramadan.","Each Risalah begins with a  supplication and eulogy, followed by another section, that blends a variety of topics. Each Risalah (epistle) is given a title gematrically equivalent to the Hijri year of its publication:[1][2] \"The context of the quoted texts is not left to the reader to determine, as in the two above-mentioned anthologies. Each text is preceded or followed by a commentary placing it within a specific theme or issue, such as the da\u02bfwa hierarchy under the imams and d\u0101\u02bf\u012bs, the nature of the authority of the d\u0101\u02bf\u012b and the da\u02bfwa dignitaries (\u1e25ud\u016bd), and the role and place of the believers in this world. In addition, each Ris\u0101la begins with the traditional introductory ta\u1e25m\u012bd, original poems in praise of the Prophet and the imams, and extensive supplications showing a rhetorical mastery of the Arabic language. The Ris\u0101las typically end with opinions on legal matters by the author or by previous d\u0101\u02bf\u012bs and da\u02bfwa dignitaries.\"[2]","Syedna Taher Saifuddin \"probably had more Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b texts at his disposal than any other \u1e6cayyib\u012b scholar before him. The wealth and variety of quoted texts make the Ras\u0101\u02beil al-Rama\u1e0d\u0101niyya a treasure trove of writings, which are otherwise inaccessible to non-initiates and low-ranking da\u02bfwa officials.\"[2]","A set of the Ras\u0101\u02beil were presented to the Bodleian Library in the University of Oxford on behalf of Syedna Taher Saifuddin 12 July 1949.[3]"]
