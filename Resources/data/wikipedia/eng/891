["K-12 was a state highway in the U.S. state of Kansas, created in the mid-1980s. Its alignment was changed during its existence.","K-12 was commissioned when the first section of the K-10 freeway was completed from K-7 in Olathe, Kansas to I-435 in Lenexa, Kansas. K-10, at the time, overlapped K-7 from K-12's western terminus in Olathe north to Shawnee Mission Parkway.[1]","When the K-10 freeway segment from Lawrence to Olathe was completed, K-10 was signed for the entire length (both sections) of the expressway. At this time, K-12 was realigned north to replace the former K-10 alignment along the Shawnee Mission Parkway. It followed the parkway from K-7 in Shawnee, then turned north on Merriam Drive in Merriam, which follows into Kansas City, Kansas. Merriam Lane turns into Southwest Boulevard near US-169, and K-12 ended not far east at the Missouri state line.[2]","Since K-12 existed entirely within the city limits of the cities it traverses, it was turned back to the cities in 1987 according to KDOT policy.[3]","Major junctions as listed shortly before K-12 was decommissioned in 1987.[4]","K-12 Spur was a .376-mile-long (0.605\u00a0km) spur route that ran from K-12 east to Interstate 35 (I-35)."]
