["Neohenricia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Aizoaceae, native to South Africa.[2] Low-lying succulents, they are found in places that can collect a little water, such as crevices and pans, on sandstone or dolorite, in areas that get at least 200\u00a0 mm of rainfall annually.[3]","The genus was named after Swiss-born South African plant physiologist Marguerite Gertrud Anna Henrici.[4]"]
