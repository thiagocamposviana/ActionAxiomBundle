["Yak Peak is a granite summit located adjacent the Coquihalla Highway in British Columbia north of Hope.[2] The mountain lies less than one km from a highway rest area, and is easily visible from a long stretch of the highway just south of the summit and tollbooths. It is known for some fine granite rock climbing routes, notably Yak Crack. Other mountains in the same group, usually known as the Anderson River Group or as the Coquihalla Range, are named after other similar animals, such as Thar Peak and Guanaco Peak.","Based on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Yak Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.[3]","Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Cascade Range where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Cascade Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below \u221220\u00a0\u00b0C with wind chill factors below \u221230\u00a0\u00b0C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Yak Peak.","This article about a location in the Interior of British Columbia, Canada is a stub.
