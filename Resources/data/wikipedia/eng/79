["The family of H\u00f6chstetter (also rendered Hechstetter or Hochstetter)[1] from H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt in western Bavaria near the banks of the  Danube were members of the fifteenth and sixteenth-century mercantile patriciate of Augsburg.","For a time, these international mercantile bankers and venture capitalists \u2013 whose most notorious member was Ambrosius H\u00f6chstetter (1463\u20131534) \u2013 were on a par with the Fugger and the Welser houses. Like other Augsburg bankers, they provided loans to Emperor Maximilian I (reigned 1508\u20131519).","The accumulating wealth of Augsburg relied on control of metal ores \u2013 the gold, silver and copper of Bohemia, Slovakia, Hungary and the Tyrol \u2013 and their refining and marketing. The Hochstetter company drew upon investments as small as a few florins, but the total invested with him required Ambrosius H\u00f6chstetter to pay out up to a million florins a year in interest. He successfully cornered for brief periods local markets in ash timber, grain and certain wines. Grain hoarding is never a popular practice, and Ambrosius was accused[by whom? ] of adulterating the spices in which he traded.[2] His son and son-in-law lost spectacular sums in gambling.[3] Then in 1529 Ambrosius H\u00f6chstetter tried to engross the whole quicksilver stock in a cartel; this failed attempt to corner the market led to his bankruptcy (1529) for 800,000 gulden, for which he would die in prison. Rising prices bring out a hidden supply, and the size of the required investment had become too large for even the greatest merchant-banking house to monopolize, as the Fuggers discovered with their attempt on the copper market. Figures representing the enormous profits of the Hochstetter at their height became public after a certain Bartholomew Rhein invested 900 gulden in the Hochstetter company in 1511; by 1517 he claimed a profit of 33,000 gulden. The company was willing to settle at 26,000, and the resulting litigation caused the figures to become public.[4] A commission of the Reichstag held at Nuremberg in 1522\u20131523 found, in part, that","\"These rich Companies, even one of them, do in the year compass much more undoing to the Commonweal than all other robbers and thieves in that they and their servants give public display of luxuriousness, pomp and prodigal wealth, of which there is no small proof in that Bartholomew Rhein did win, in so short a time and with so little stock of trade, such notable riches in the Hochstetter Company \u2014 as hath openly appeared in the justifying before the City Court at Augsburg and at the Reichstag but lately held at Worms.\"[5]","The house of H\u00f6chstetter itself did not go under. In 1526 Sir Richard Gresham, when detained at Neuport, sent a letter with Joachim H\u00f6chstetter to Cardinal Wolsey, characterising H\u00f6chstetter as one of the richest and most influential merchants of Germany and a great exporter of wheat to London.[6] The H\u00f6chstetter were also involved in the Elizabethan copper-mining venture, the Society of Mines Royal.","Richard Ehrenberg describes the sixteenth-century economic activities in which the Hochstetter participated in a classic work, Das Zeitalter der Fugger:  Geldkapital und Kreditverkehr im 16. Jahrhundert (\"The Age of the Fuggers: Capital and the Credit Market in the Sixteenth Century\") Jena, 1896.","The H\u00f6chstetter were ennobled by Imperial patent, 1518,[1] as H\u00f6chstetter von Burgwalden."]
