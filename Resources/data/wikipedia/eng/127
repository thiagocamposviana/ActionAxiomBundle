["Settsu-shi Station (\u6442\u6d25\u5e02\u99c5 , Settsushi-eki, station number: HK-67)  is a railway station on the Hanky\u016b Ky\u014dto Main Line in Settsu, Osaka, Japan. The newest station of the Hankyu system as of 2010 was built for a redevelopment area and is designed as the country's first ever carbon neutral station.[1]","The station is served by local trains on the Ky\u014dto Main Line. All higher types of trains pass the station.","The station has two side platforms, connected each other by an underground passage, serving two tracks. Each platform has a ticket gate that serves each side of the station.[2]","The station was featured as the first ever carbon neutral railway station in Japan. According to an estimate in 2008, the station would emit 65 tons of carbon dioxide per year. To make the station carbon neutral, the railway company would reduce this figure by 35 tons by technical measures such as usage of solar power, regeneration by elevators, and reduction of water usage. The remaining 30 tons would be offset by purchase of carbon credit and so forth.[1][3]"]
