["HD 27894 b is a gas giant with a mass at least two thirds that of Jupiter, or twice that of Saturn. The distance from the planet to the star is one third compared that of Mercury from our Sun, and it takes almost exactly 18 days to complete one roughly circular orbit.[1]","This extrasolar-planet-related article is a stub.
