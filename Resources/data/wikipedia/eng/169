["TJ Faiane (born 24 August 1995) is a New Zealand rugby union player who currently plays as a midfield back for  Auckland in New Zealand's domestic Mitre 10 Cup and the  Blues in the international Super Rugby competition.[1][2][3][4]","A teenage prodigy, Faiane made a big impression playing first XV rugby for Saint Kentigern College in Auckland, helping them win 3 successive 1A Championship titles.[4]","Aged just 18, Faiane was named in the Auckland squad for the 2014 ITM Cup, and he went on to make 7 appearances for them during the season, 5 of which were from the start.   Injuries ruled him out of the 2015 and 2016 seasons so he has so far been unable to add to his seven provincial caps.[2][5]","Despite missing the entire 2015 New Zealand domestic season through injury, new  Blues head-coach Tana Umaga sprang a surprise ahead of the 2016 Super Rugby season when he named Faiane as a member of the franchise's wider training group.[6]   Once again injuries hindered him and he didn't make any appearances during the year.   Despite this, he was given a full contract for the 2017 season.[3]","Faiane represented New Zealand schools in 2013 and was a member of the New Zealand Under 20 squads which competed in the 2014 and 2015 World Rugby Under 20 Championships, finishing in 3rd and 1st places respectively.[7][8][9][10]"]
