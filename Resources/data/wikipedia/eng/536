["Aksaray Province (Turkish: Aksaray ili ) is a province in central Turkey. Its adjacent provinces are Konya along the west and south, Ni\u011fde to the southeast, Nev\u015fehir to the east, and K\u0131r\u015fehir to the north. It covers an area of 7,626 square kilometres (2,944\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). The provincial capital is the city of Aksaray.","Aksaray is one of the four provinces in the area of Cappadocia, along with Nev\u015fehir, Ni\u011fde and Kayseri. Also the 3,000-metre (9,843\u00a0ft) volcano Mount Hasan stands between Aksaray and Ni\u011fde. Summers are hot and dry on the plain, but the area is green and covered in flowers in springtime, when water streams off the mountainside. The 2,400\u00a0m2 salt lake (0.59 acres), Tuz G\u00f6l\u00fc, lies within the boundaries of Aksaray, a large area of swamp with a maximum depth of 1 metre (3\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in).","Aksaray province is divided into 7 districts (capital district in bold):","In antiquity the area was named Archelais Garsaura, which was mutated to Taksara during the Seljuk Turkish era, and then to Aksaray.","The plains of central Anatolia have been settled for 8,000 years, and the area around Aksaray bears monuments to a string of civilisations that have settled on the plain in that time. The mound of A\u015f\u0131kl\u0131 H\u00f6y\u00fck in the town of K\u0131z\u0131lkaya indicates a settlement dating back to 5,000BC (and also a skull of a woman who had apparently been trepanned, the earliest known record of brain surgery).","Later the Silk Road came through here so caravanserai and then larger and larger settlements were built to supply and shelter travellers and traders. The city and surroundings of Aksaray thrived in the Roman, Byzantine and the Turkish periods.","Today Aksaray is a rural, agricultural province, its people religious and conservative.[citation needed ] Since the 1950s many have moved to Europe as migrant workers. The population of Aksaray has long included a higher proportion of Kurdish people than most central Anatolian provinces. Many of them were resettled here from Tunceli and other eastern cities following the Sheikh Said rebellion in the 1920s.[2]"]
