["Alicastrum brownei Kuntze\r\n Brosimum uleanum Mildbr.\r\n Helicostylis bolivarensis Pittier\r\n Piratinera alicastrum (Sw.) Baill.","Brosimum alicastrum, commonly known as the breadnut or ramon, is a tree species in the  family Moraceae of flowering plants, whose other genera include figs and mulberries. The plant is known by a range of names in indigenous Mesoamerican and other languages, including:  ojoche, ojite, ojushte, ujushte, ujuxte, capomo, mojo, ox, iximche, masica in Honduras, uje in the state of Michoacan Mexico, and mojote in Jalisco, or also chokogou in Haitian Creole.[citation needed ]","The tree can grow up to 45\u00a0m (130\u00a0ft) in height and up to 1.5 m in diameter.[1]","This tree is found on the west coast of central Mexico and in southern Mexico (Yucat\u00e1n, Campeche), Guatemala, El Salvador, the Caribbean, and the Amazon.  Large stands occur in moist lowland tropical forests at 300\u20132000\u00a0m elevation (especially 125\u2013800\u00a0m), in humid areas with rainfall of 600\u20132000\u00a0mm, and average temperatures of 24\u00a0\u00b0C (75\u00a0\u00b0F).[2]","The breadnut fruit disperses on the ground at different times throughout its range. It has a large seed covered by a thin, citrus-flavored, orange-colored skin favored by a number of forest creatures. More importantly, the large seed which is enveloped by the tasty skin is an edible \u2018nut\u2019 that can be boiled or dried and ground into a meal for porridge or flatbread. Breadnut is nutritious and has value as a food source, and may have formed a part of the diet of the pre-Columbian Maya of the lowlands region in Mesoamerica,[3][4] although to what extent has been a matter of some debate among historians and archaeologists and no verified remains or illustrations of the fruit have been found at any Mayan archaeological sites.[citation needed ]","It was planted by the Maya civilization 2000 years ago and it has been claimed in several publications by Dennis E. Puleston to have been a staple food in the Maya diet.[4]  Puleston demonstrated a strong correlation between ancient Maya settlement patterns and the distribution of relic stands of ramon trees.[5]","Other research has downplayed the ramon's significance.  In the modern era, it has been marginalized as a source of nutrition and has often been characterized as a famine food.[citation needed ]","The tree lends its name to the Maya archaeological sites of Iximch\u00e9 and Topoxte, both in Guatemala and Tamuin (reflecting the Maya origin of the Huastec peoples).  It is one of the 20 dominant species of the Maya forest.[6] Of the dominant species, it is the only one that is wind-pollinated. It is also found in traditional Maya forest gardens.[7]","The breadnut is high in fiber, calcium, potassium, folate, iron, zinc, protein and B vitamins.[3] It has a low glycemic index (<50) and is very high in antioxidants. The fresh seeds can be cooked and eaten or can be set out to dry in the sun and eaten later. Stewed, the nut tastes like mashed potato; roasted, it tastes like chocolate or coffee.  It can be prepared in numerous other dishes. In Pet\u00e9n, Guatemala, the breadnut is being cultivated for exportation and local consumption as powder, for hot beverages, and bread.[citation needed ]","Breadnut leaves are commonly used as forage for livestock during the dry season in Central America. The fruits and seeds are also used to feed all kinds of animals.[1][8]","Brosimum alicastrum can be used for carbon farming as a nut crop or fodder.[9]"]
