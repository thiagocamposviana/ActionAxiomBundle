The Trinity Church was originally built, of stone, in 1865, but was closed on 19 September 1939 by the Soviet administration and demolished. The present wooden church is in poor condition.","The brick structure of The Holy Trinity church has been completed. Outside walls are white concrete stucco, and the roof is green metal. The interior is still under construction in early 2014. A stone monument was placed near the church which has a plaque reads (in Russian): \"By the Grace of God and hard labor of the music group Buranovskie Grandmothers, on this place will be built a temple to honor the Holy Trinity. This stone laid Oct 28, 2011.\""]
