["Kurixalus verrucosus (Boulenger's bushfrog, small rough-armed tree frog) is a species of frog in the family Rhacophoridae found in Myanmar, Thailand, China, and Vietnam. In the past, it has been considered synonym of Rhacophorus appendiculatus (=Kurixalus appendiculatus), which, together with other confusion regarding the identity of this species, makes interpreting older literature difficult.[2] Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, subtropical or tropical moist montane forests, rivers, and intermittent rivers. It is threatened by habitat loss.[1]","This Rhacophoridae article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it."]
