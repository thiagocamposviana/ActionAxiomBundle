["Thirty Years of Maximum R&B Live is a 1994 compilation video of English rock and roll band The Who. The compilation covers the band live from 1965 to 1989 and is edited together with interviews with band members Roger Daltrey, John Entwistle, and Pete Townshend. A 4-disc compilation boxset called Thirty Years of Maximum R&B released in 1994 is also available.","The DVD was released in 2001 and was eventually re-released (renamed Maximum R&B Live) as a 2-disc package with the bonus content of the Rockpalast concert from 28 March 1981.[1]  The Tanglewood Music Shed songs from 1970 have been removed though and replaced by songs from London Colliseum 1969, Kilburn 1977 and Shea Stadium 1982."]
