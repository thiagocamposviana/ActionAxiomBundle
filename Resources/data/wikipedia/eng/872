When this station fired him after 15 years of work, Venevisi\u00f3n hired him as part of the cast of the Chever\u00edsimo comedy show. He was considered as one of the most outstanding comedians in Venezuela.","Tuero, his wife, his daughter, and one granddaughter were part of the countless victims of the Vargas tragedy. On December 16, 1999, around noon his house located in Los Corales, Vargas State, was buried under a massive landslide. His relatives in Caracas warned him to evacuate the house, but he said: This house is 27 years old and I feel more secure in here.[3]","This Venezuelan biographical article is a stub.
