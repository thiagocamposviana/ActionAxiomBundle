Former Western Australian premier Philip Collier was born and raised in Woodstock.","Woodstock Post Office opened on 9 January 1858 and closed in 1971. To the west Woodstock West Post office opened in 1877 and continued operating until 1959.[2] In September 1876 a small timber Catholic church, known as the church of St. Patrick, was erected for local worshippers.[3]","Deputations were made to the Victorian government during the 1890s to bring a railway line through the area. It was decided that the Sydney-Melbourne rail corridor would run to the west, parallel with the Hume Highway, and so the closest railway station is at Donnybrook approximately 8\u00a0km away.[4]","Jones, Michael Nature's Plenty: a history of the City of Whittlesea, Sydney, N.S.W.
