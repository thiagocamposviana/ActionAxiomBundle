Its northern terminus is at SR\u00a0309 approximately 4 miles (6.4\u00a0km) northwest of Marion.","SR\u00a0203 traverses the northwestern portion of Delaware County and the southern half of Marion County.  There are no segments of SR\u00a0203 that are included within the National Highway System (NHS), a network of highways deemed to be most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the country.[5]","SR\u00a0203 was established in 1923.  The highway was originally routed along its current alignment between its present southern terminus, at the time designated as SR\u00a047, and its junction with what is now SR\u00a0739, but in 1923 known as SR\u00a038.[1][2]  In 1938, SR\u00a0203 was extended north to its present terminus at what is now SR\u00a0309, but at the time a part of the now-defunct U.S. Route 30S (US\u00a030S).[6][7]"]
