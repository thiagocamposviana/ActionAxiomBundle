["Fort Lamotte was a fort created between 1810 and 1812 by Baptists [1] near Palestine, Illinois. It was the site of the Battle of Africa Point in the War of 1812, one of few battles of the war in the Illinois Territory.[2] During the War of 1812 there were 26 families living in Fort LaMotte, and 90 rangers under the command of frontier officer Captain Pierce Andrews.[3] It was in use through 1817 and is currently being recreated.[4][5] The inhabitants of the Fort became the nucleus of Palestine. Fort Foot served as an expansion of and partial replacement for Fort Lamotte.[6]","A marker at Palestine indicates that Frenchman John Lamotte became separated from the Lasalle party and reached the region in 1678.[7]","Coordinates: 38\u00b059\u203252.4\u2033N  87\u00b035\u203254.1\u2033W   \ufeff \/ \ufeff 38.997889\u00b0N 87.598361\u00b0W \ufeff \/ 38.997889; -87.598361","This Crawford County, Illinois location article is a stub.
