["System of a Down is the debut studio album by American heavy metal band System of a Down, released on June 30, 1998, by American Recordings and Columbia Records. The album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on February 2, 2000.","After the success of System of a Down's following album, Toxicity (2001), the album was certified platinum.[3]","The album is generally considered nu metal and alternative metal, both of which would became staples for the band. Lyrical themes throughout the album vary, with many songs following a theme of being anti-war, but also has topics of genocide, religion, and brainwashing. \"Suite-Pee\" is a criticism of pedophilia within the Church and religious extremism.[4] \"Soil\" is, according to lead singer Serj Tankian, \"about death, and friends that die, and life that dies.\" \"Mind\" talks about government mind control, specifically mentioning CIA brainwashing in the albums' liner notes. \"P.L.U.C.K.\" is a song dedicated to the victims of the Armenian Genocide, and is meant to be a criticism and denouncing of the Turkish Government.","In the liner notes, footnotes appear under some of the song's titles, giving some incite into the song's respective context. For example, \"War?\" contains the footnote \"We first fought the heathens in the name of religion, then Communism, and now in the name of drugs and terrorism. Our excuses for global domination always change.\"","The cover artwork is from a 1928 anti-fascist poster designed by visual artist John Heartfield for the Communist Party of Germany.[3] The text on the original poster is: \"A hand has 5 fingers! With these 5 grab the enemy!\"[5] This slogan inspired part of the text contained on the back of the System of a Down album: \"The hand has five fingers, capable and powerful, with the ability to destroy as well as create\". Later, it is written in bold letters: \"Open your eyes, open your mouths, close your hands and make a fist\" (used later by Serj Tankian in the song \"Uneducated Democracy\").","System of a Down received acclaim from music critics.[11] Q called it \"an excellent starting point for this most curious band\".[8]","The album is featured in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.[12] Loudwire included the album in its list of The Best Metal Debut Albums, at number 22.[13]","All lyrics written by Serj Tankian, except where noted, and all music written by Daron Malakian, except where noted.","The songs \"Honey\" and \"Temper\" from Demo Tape 2 were recorded for this album as well but ultimately did not make the cut. The re-recorded versions of these songs have yet to surface anywhere.[14][15]","* Sales figures based on certification alone.\r\n^ Shipments figures based on certification alone.\r\n Sales+streaming figures based on certification alone."]
