["PX domain containing serine\/threonine kinase also known as PXK is a protein which in humans is encoded by the PXK gene.[1][2]","PXK binds to the Na\u207a\/K\u207a-ATPase beta-1 (ATP1B1) and beta-3 (ATP1B3) subunits and modulates both Na\u207a\/K\u207a-ATPase enzymatic and ion pump activities.[2]","This article incorporates text from the United States National Library of Medicine, which is in the public domain.","This article on a gene on human chromosome 3 is a stub.
