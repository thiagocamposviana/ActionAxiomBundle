["Sporting Col\u00f3n was a Panamanian football team based on Col\u00f3n, Panama.","Los correcaminos, as they were known, was a historic team for Col\u00f3n as they hold numerous records for the province such as being their first team in ANAPROF, first to reach a final in the 1992\u201393 season and first to play at an international level during the 1993 season of the CONCACAF Champions' Cup.","Sporting Col\u00f3n's short history in ANAPROF began in 1991 after being promoted from the Copa Rommel Fern\u00e1ndez in the 1991 season alongside UTP[1] (up until 1995, the winners from the Copa Rommel Fern\u00e1ndez were promoted to ANAPROF). In their first season in the Panamanian top league, Sporting Col\u00f3n finished in a disappointing 7th place out of 8 teams in the competition. However, the next season proved to be completely different. In the 1992\u201393 championship, Sporting Col\u00f3n surprisingly reached the final after a disastrous first round which followed an impressive run in the second round of the championship that granted them the chance to play in ANAPROF's first final against Plaza Amador. Before, however, they defeated Pan de Az\u00facar 3\u20132 in extra time in the semifinals. The final was played on January 17, 1993 at the Estadio Revoluci\u00f3n (now Estadio Rommel Fern\u00e1ndez) and Plaza Amador defeated Sporting Col\u00f3n 3\u20130.[2] Nevertheless, this runner-up position gave the correcaminos the chance to play in the CONCACAF Champions' Cup later that year. The next season, however, was Sporting Col\u00f3n's last in ANAPROF. The year started with a disappointing elimination against Guatemalan side Comunincaciones in the preliminary round of the CONCACAF Champions' Cup competition after being defeated twice on a 4\u20132 aggregate score. In ANAPROF, although the team finished 3rd in the general table and therefore earning them a spot in the semifinals, they were eliminated by Euro Kickers with a 2\u20133 aggregate score. Their last game in ANAPROF was on November 21 at the Pedregale\u00f1a and they defeated Euro Kickers 1\u20130.","Although it is still not completely clear why Sporting Col\u00f3n did not participate in the following season of the ANAPROF championship it has been said that after the split between ANAPROF and LINFUNA (which had the Panamanian Football Federation's endorsement) many sport leaders joined LINFUNA instead of ANAPROF, among those was Col\u00f3n's sport leadership. As the province already had a team participating in the competition (\u00c1rabe Unido) many players from Sporting Col\u00f3n were forced to leave the team and join \u00c1rabe Unido in order to play in LINFUNA (among those included Rogelio Clarke, Mart\u00edn Tu\u00f1on and Eric Medina). After this incident, Sporting Col\u00f3n ceased to exist as a professional football team."]
