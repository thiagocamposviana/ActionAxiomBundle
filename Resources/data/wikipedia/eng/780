Klitschko then turned his attention to fighting Browne instead on 10 December, a date that his team had booked for an arena in Germany.[8] A deal could not be finalised for Joshua vs. Klitschko, due to the WBA delaying a decision to sanction the fight and Klitschko injuring himself, which put the fight off completely.[9] Klitschko said he would be looking to fight Joshua in the first quarter of 2017.[10] Talks between the Klitschko camp and Hearn remained active with a fight set for the first part of 2017.[11][12]","Bryant Jennings and David Price were the names being pushed forward to fight Joshua next, however it was announced Joshua would be fighting at the Manchester Arena, defending his title against former world title challenger \u00c9ric Molina (25\u20133, 19 KOs), who was coming off a stoppage victory against Tomasz Adamek.

It was announced that Joshua and Klitschko would face each other for the IBF and vacant WBA (Super) titles at Wembley Stadium, London, on 29 April 2017.[17] WBA president Gilberto J. Mendoza confirmed that the winner would have to face mandatory challenger Luis Ortiz next, with deadlines due to be set after the unification fight.[18][19] It was then confirmed that the winner between Joshua and Klitschko had to face Kubrat Pulev next as the IBF's mandatory challenger.[20]","In January 2017, Eddie Hearn announced that more than 80,000 tickets had been sold, a new box office record, overtaking Carl Froch vs. George Groves II.

Klitschko again rose but Joshua knocked him down for a second time in the round, then sent a barrage of punches while Klitschko was against the ropes that made the referee stop the fight.[29][30]","At the time of stoppage, Joshua was ahead on two judges' scorecards with 96\u201393 and 95\u201393, while the third judge had Klitschko ahead at 95\u201393.
