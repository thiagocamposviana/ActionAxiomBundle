["In Japan, a r\u014dnin (\u6d6a\u4eba , \u308d\u3046\u306b\u3093)  is a student who has graduated from middle school or high school but has failed to enter a school at the next level, and consequently is studying outside of the school system for entrance in a future year.[1][2] R\u014dnin may study at a  yobik\u014d.","The term r\u014dnin is colloquial; the word kanendosei (\u904e\u5e74\u5ea6\u751f )  is more formal. The term derives from their having no school to attend, as a r\u014dnin, a masterless samurai, had no leader to serve.","Sometimes, the term \u4e8c\u6d6a (short form) or \u4e8c\u5e74\u6d6a\u4eba (full form, \u4e8c\u5e74 - second year) is used for student who failed exams twice.","R\u014dnin appear frequently in fiction and Japanese popular culture. As an example, the manga and anime series Love Hina features three main characters, Keitaro Urashima, Naru Narusegawa, and Mutsumi Otohime, who are described as r\u014dnin throughout most of the series. In the manga and anime series Chobits, the protagonist, Hideki Motosuwa, is a r\u014dnin studying at a preparatory school to get into college. Maison Ikkoku also features a r\u014dnin as its main character; the series centers around his studying for exams as he is distracted by others that he lives with. The protagonist of Sekirei, Minato Sahashi, is also a r\u014dnin. Kanamemo's Hinata Azuma is a roninsei as well due to her love of gambling and money making, activities which hinder her studies.","This article about an aspect of Japanese education is a stub.
