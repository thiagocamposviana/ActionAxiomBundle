["Kust\u00e1ni or Kust\u00e1nyi was a minor noble family in the Kingdom of Hungary, which first appeared in the late 13th century and had estates and villages mostly in Zala County.","The first member of the family was Ladislaus I (fl. 1274), who originated from the Zala branch of the gens (clan) P\u00e9c, as the son of Lucas II (also known as Lucas the Great). Ladislaus took his surname after Kust\u00e1n or Kust\u00e1ny (present-day part of Kehidakust\u00e1ny).","The most notable member of the family was Daniel, who attended the national Diets as a representative of the nobles in the 1440s."]
