["NASCAR Countdown was a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series and Nationwide Series prerace show that debuted on February 17, 2007. It was a live on-site pre-race show for all Sprint Cup and Nationwide Series races televised on ESPN, ESPN2 and ABC. It came as a result of ESPN getting broadcast rights to NASCAR races, including the Chase for the Sprint Cup.","The program was also available in high-definition on either ESPN, ESPN2 or ABC. Along with the press release of this program, ESPN also announced plans for a daily show devoted to NASCAR entitled NASCAR Now. NASCAR Countdown  was telecast from a new, state-of-the-art mobile pit studio, similar to NASCAR on Fox's \"Hollywood Hotel.\"","At Sprint Cup events, the program was always hosted by Nicole Briscoe. Joining Briscoe was five-time NBA All-Star and former winning NASCAR team owner Brad Daugherty and former Cup champion Rusty Wallace. Andy Petree and Dale Jarrett also contributed to the program from the broadcast booth."]
