["Melbourne University Publishing (MUP) is the book publishing arm of the University of Melbourne.","MUP was founded in 1922 as Melbourne University Press to sell text books and stationery to students, and soon began publishing books itself.  Over the years scholarly works published under the MUP imprint have won numerous awards and prizes. The name Melbourne University Publishing was adopted for the business in 2003 following a restructure by the University, but books continue to be published under the Melbourne University Press imprint.[2]","The Miegunyah Press is an imprint of MUP, established in 1967 under a bequest from businessman and philanthropist Russell Grimwade, with the intention of subsidising the publication of illustrated scholarly works that would otherwise be uneconomic to publish.  Grimwade's great-grandnephew Andrew Grimwade is the present patron.  Miegunyah is from an Aboriginal Australian language, meaning \"my house\".[3]","MUP also is the current publisher of the literary journal Meanjin.","Laurie Muller, Say Goodbye to Melbourne University Publishing, Sydney Morning Herald, 7 February 2019[4]","Nathan Hollier, MUP, Looking Ahead, Australian Book Review, 1 July 2019[5]"]
