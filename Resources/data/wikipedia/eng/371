["The Abba River is a river in the South West of Western Australia.","The headwaters of the river rise in the Whicher Range in the Millbrook State Forest then flow in a northerly direction. The river crosses the Vasse Highway and then through Wonnerup Siding before discharging into the Vasse Estuary East of Busselton and finally the Indian Ocean.","The river was named in 1834 by Frederick Ludlow. The name is Aboriginal in origin and is a greeting word used by the local peoples.[3]","Construction of  a bridge over the Abba and the Sabina River commenced in 1860, despite dreadful weather, and the rivers running high at the time.[4]","Coordinates: 33\u00b039\u20326\u2033S  115\u00b027\u203240\u2033E   \ufeff \/ \ufeff 33.65167\u00b0S 115.46111\u00b0E \ufeff \/ -33.65167; 115.46111"]
