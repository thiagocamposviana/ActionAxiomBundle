["The 2018 Korean Tour was the eighth season of the Korean Tour to carry Official World Golf Ranking points. The season consisted of 17 events, three of which are co-sanctioned by the Asian Tour. All the tournaments had prize funds of at least 500 million won (approximately US$480,000). Nine have prize funds of 1 billion won ($960,000) or more.","The number in brackets after each winner's name is the number of Korean Tour events he had won up to and including that tournament.","The Order of Merit used a points system, called Genesis Points. Points were awarded based on the player's position in each event. 1,000 points were awarded to the winner, 600 points for second place, down to 5 points for those finishing outside the top 60. All 17 events had the same points. Lee Hyung-joon did not win any tournaments but made the cut in all 17 events and was second twice and third three times.","'Events' refers to the number of tournaments in which the player won prize money."]
