["The School District of Greenfield is a school district located in southwestern Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, which serves the City of Greenfield.","In 2012, the district selected former district educator and administrator, Lisa Elliott, to become superintendent of the school district.[1]","Before Greenfield incorporated as a city in 1957, there were a number of school districts throughout the town for neighborhood elementary schools. Parents could pick which high school in Milwaukee County they wanted to send their children. But in the late 1950s, changes in state law and overfilled high schools meant that Greenfield needed to build a high school of its own. This task was made difficult as the surrounding municipalities of Milwaukee, West Allis, West Milwaukee, Hales Corners, and Greendale continued to carve out pieces of the Town of Greenfield. Every annexation required the school districts affected to pay money to the annexing municipality, draining coffers. In the late 1950s, Greenfield incorporated as a city and the several small school districts consolidated into two: Whitnall School District and Greenfield School District.[2]","Passage of two referendums allowed for major additions and improvements to Greenfield High School that included a new performing arts center, fitness center, academic wing, and swimming pool. After the 2010 construction was completed, district offices were combined with the high school complex.","The Greenfield School Board consists of seven members.[4] Each member is compensated $4,500 annually and can serve an unlimited number of three-year terms.","Coordinates: 42\u00b057\u203228.1\u2033N  87\u00b057\u203216.3\u2033W   \ufeff \/ \ufeff 42.957806\u00b0N 87.954528\u00b0W \ufeff \/ 42.957806; -87.954528","This Wisconsin school-related article is a stub.
