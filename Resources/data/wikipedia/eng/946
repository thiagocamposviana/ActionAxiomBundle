["Eschatology: Death and Eternal Life (German: Eschatologie, Tod und ewiges Leben) is a 1988 book written by Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI). The book is the study of the \"eschaton\", the times of the end, or \"last things\", such as the parousia, heaven, and hell. Among the issues addressed in it is the concept of purgatory, which he argues may be existential\u2014not temporal\u2014in duration.[1]","This article related to an official document of the Catholic Church is a stub.
