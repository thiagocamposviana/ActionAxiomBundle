["In cellular automata, the von Neumann neighborhood (or 4-neighborhood) is classically defined on a two-dimensional square lattice and is composed of a central cell and its four adjacent cells.[1]  The neighborhood is named after John von Neumann, who used it to define the von Neumann cellular automaton and the von Neumann universal constructor within it.[2]  It is one of the two most commonly used neighborhood types for two-dimensional cellular automata, the other one being the Moore neighborhood.","This neighbourhood can be used to define the notion of 4-connected pixels in computer graphics.[3]","The von Neumann neighbourhood of a cell is the cell itself and the cells at a Manhattan distance of 1.","The concept can be extended to higher dimensions, for example forming a 6-cell octahedral neighborhood for a cubic cellular automaton in three dimensions.[4]","An extension of the simple von Neumann neighborhood described above is to take the set of points at a Manhattan distance of r\u00a0>\u00a01. This results in a diamond-shaped region (shown for r\u00a0=\u00a02 in the illustration). These are called von Neumann neighborhoods of range or extent r. The number of cells in a 2-dimensional von Neumann neighborhood of range r can be expressed as                                    r                        2                             +         (         r         +         1                    )                        2                                     {\\displaystyle r^{2}+(r+1)^{2}}      . The number of cells in a d-dimensional von Neumann neighborhood of range r is the Delannoy number D(d,r).[4] The number of cells on a surface of a d-dimensional von Neumann neighborhood of range r is the Zaitsev number (sequence A266213  in the OEIS).","This theoretical computer science\u2013related article is a stub.
