["Bernard I (died 995), called the Cross-Eyed, was the first Count of Armagnac.","He was the second son of William Garc\u00e9s of F\u00e9zensac. When William died in 960, he divided his county up, giving F\u00e9zensac to his eldest son Odo, Armagnac to Bernard, and Gaure\u00a0[fr]  to the youngest son Fredelon.","For his many sins, Bernard planned a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, but never accomplished the feat. Instead, he founded a basilica dedicated to Saint Orens of Auch. His son Gerald succeeded him."]
