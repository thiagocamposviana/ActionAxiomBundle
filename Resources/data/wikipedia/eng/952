Touches on the Ten Divine Emanations depicted on the Qabalistic Tree of Life.","Inspirational Thoughts on the Tarot.  Davies' original poetry, discussion of the attribution of the Tarot Keys and material from Davies' Tarot classes are blended together in essays examining each of the Major Tarot Keys.","Monograph on Principles of Health and Diet.  Advice and guidance about physical health from a Qabalistic perspective.","Many of Davies' lectures and monographs on Qabalah, occult tarot, meditation and astrology are described at the B.O.T.A. website.","Some biographical material on Davies can be found in the book Paul Foster Case.
