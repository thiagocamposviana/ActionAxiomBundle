Before the first European Nintendo Direct aired, Shibata had very seldom appeared in public due to his shyness;[4] however, he gained greater exposure following his appearances in those presentations, as well as in letters sent to Nintendo 3DS owners in Nintendo Letter Box.[3]","This Nintendo-related article is a stub.
