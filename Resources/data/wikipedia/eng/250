["The 2011 Indianapolis Colts season was the franchise\u2019s 59th season in the National Football League, the 28th in Indianapolis and the third (and last) under head coach Jim Caldwell. The Colts were coming off a 10\u20136 record in 2010 and a second consecutive AFC South championship, as well as a ninth consecutive playoff appearance. In 2011, the Colts were looking to set an NFL record for the most consecutive playoff appearances (10) and be the first NFL team to play a Super Bowl in its home stadium (Super Bowl XLVI was held in Indianapolis).","The Colts had placed their franchise tag on star quarterback Peyton Manning before the season started but he sat out the entire season due to neck surgery. The Colts turned to retired quarterback Kerry Collins and then to Curtis Painter, neither of whom could fill Manning\u2019s void.[1] The team finished the season with a 2\u201314 record, the worst regular season record by a Colts team since 1991, and failed to make the playoffs for the first time since 2001.","The Colts offense had weakened rapidly in 2011. They were 30th in the league in yards gained (compared to 4th in 2010), 27th in passing yards (compared to 1st in 2010), 29th in receiving yards (compared to 2nd in 2010), 28th in scoring (compared to 4th in 2010), and 28th in total touchdowns (compared to 2nd in 2010).","The Colts set a dubious NFL record on pass defense, by allowing 71.2% completed passes by opposing passers.[2]","On January 2, 2012, one day after the final game of the season, Colts owner Jim Irsay fired team Vice Chairman Bill Polian and his son, team Vice President and general manager Chris Polian. Irsay stated that the fate of head coach Jim Caldwell was still under review. On January 17, 2012, Irsay announced the firing of Caldwell as the head coach of the Colts.[3] On March 7, 2012, Manning was released by the Colts. These moves marked the first major rebuilding of the team since the Polians had joined the team.[4][5][6]","The Indianapolis Colts began their 2011 season at Reliant Stadium against the Houston Texans.  For the first time since the 1998 season, Peyton Manning was not under the helm at quarterback and it was recently acquired Kerry Collins that would take his position.  The game started very well for the Colts, opening up with an interception by Melvin Bullitt that allowed the Colts to take control.  However, a three and out from the offense quickly gave the Texans the ball to drive down and score a field goal and take a 3\u20130 lead.  Collins and the Colts offense was out of sync for much of the first quarter, fumbling two snaps and giving Houston the great field position inside of the Indianapolis 40-yard line.  After the first quarter, the Texans held a commanding 17\u20130 lead and were firing on all cylinders.  The second quarter continued Houston\u2019s dominance, with all three teams of the Colts failing to stop or to execute against the Texans.  At halftime, the Colts trailed Houston 34\u20130, the largest deficit in the entire 58-year history of the franchise.  The second half saw little action with both teams taking shorter drives and in some senses, running down the clock.  The Colts scored their first and the only points scored in the second half with a Reggie Wayne touchdown from Collins in the fourth quarter.  The Colts went on to lose to the Texans 34\u20137, their second straight season starting 0\u20131.","at Lucas Oil Stadium, Indianapolis, Indiana","The Indianapolis Colts home opener had their 2011 home opener against the 0\u20131 Cleveland Browns.  The first quarter saw both teams getting into offensive and defensive rhythms and ended with the Colts holding only a 3\u20130 lead on an Adam Vinatieri field goal.  Heading to the second quarter, the Colts offense began to pick up behind Kerry Collins, rookie Delone Carter, and Joseph Addai.  However much of the success faded once Indianapolis reached the red zone, and were only able to come away with two field goals during the quarter.  Cleveland, however, was able to capitalize on the Colts defense, and saw a touchdown pass from Colt McCoy and a touchdown run from Peyton Hillis.  Cleveland went into halftime with a 14\u20139 lead.  The Indianapolis defense was able to stop Cleveland for most of the third quarter, and allowed the struggling offensive to close the gap with a fourth Vinatieri field goal, with Cleveland still holding a 14\u201312 lead into the fourth quarter.  Cleveland quickly drove down the field and started the quarter with a Phil Dawson field goal, allowing the Colts to remain in contention for the victory.  However, after turnovers and an inability to produce on offense, Cleveland broke the game open with a Hillis touchdown run, along with another Dawson field goal with 2:59 remaining in the game.  With Cleveland holding a 27\u201312 lead, Indianapolis was able to score their first touchdown of the game, allowing them to try an onside kick to preserve any chance of a comeback, which they were not able to convert.  Cleveland finished the game and the Colts by winning 27\u201319, their first victory over the Colts since 1994, and the Colts first 0\u20132 start since the 1998 season.","at Lucas Oil Stadium, Indianapolis, Indiana","Hoping to rebound from their loss to the Cleveland Browns, the Indianapolis Colts remained at home for a week three intra-conference matchup with the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday night.  Indianapolis trailed early in the first quarter as Steelers kicker Shaun Suisham got a 48-yard field goal, followed by quarterback Ben Roethlisberger completing an 81-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Mike Wallace.  The Colts would answer in the second quarter with a 21-yard field goal from kicker Adam Vinatieri, followed by defensive end Jamaal Anderson returning a fumble, forced by Dwight Freeney, 47 yards for a touchdown.  Another defensive turnover allowed the Colts and Vinatieri to score a 25-yard field goal, giving them a 13\u201310 lead at halftime.  After a scoreless third quarter, Pittsburgh took the lead in the fourth quarter with a Suisham 44-yard field goal, followed by safety Troy Polamalu returning a fumble 16 yards for a touchdown.  Indianapolis would tie the game again on running back Joseph Addai\u2019s 6-yard touchdown run with 2:15 remaining in the game. However, the Steelers were able to capture the win with a final 38-yard field goal from Suisham, dropping the Colts to 0\u20133.","at Raymond James Stadium, Tampa, Florida","Hoping to rebound from their home loss to the Steelers, the Colts flew to Raymond James Stadium for a Week 4 Monday night duel with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. With quarterback Kerry Collins recovering from concussion, quarterback Curtis Painter would make his first career start. Indianapolis delivered the game\u2019s opening punch in the first quarter with a 45-yard field goal from kicker Adam Vinatieri. The Colts would add onto their lead in the second quarter with Painter finding wide receiver Pierre Gar\u00e7on on an 87-yard touchdown pass, yet the Buccaneers answered with quarterback Josh Freeman getting a 1-yard touchdown run.  Tampa Bay would tie the game in the third quarter with kicker Connor Barth getting a 46-yard field goal, yet Indianapolis came right back with Painter hooking up Gar\u00e7on again on a 59-yard touchdown pass. Afterwards, the Buccaneers tied the game with Freeman completing a 13-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Preston Parker. Tampa Bay would take the lead in the fourth quarter with running back LeGarrette Blount getting a 35-yard touchdown run. From there, the defense prevented any comeback from the Colts\u2019 offense. With the loss, the Colts dropped to 0\u20134.","at Lucas Oil Stadium, Indianapolis, Indiana","After dropping their first four games of the season, the Indianapolis Colts came back to Lucas Oil Stadium to take on the Kansas City Chiefs.  The game opened well for the Colts, who scored on their opening drive with a Curtis Painter to Pierre Gar\u00e7on touchdown reception. In the second quarter, the Colts scored with an Adam Vinatieri field goal and another Painter to Gar\u00e7on touchdown, giving Indianapolis a 17\u20130 lead midway through the second quarter.  A Kansas City touchdown pass from Matt Cassel ended the shutout but Indianapolis scored another touchdown later. A late Kansas City touchdown allowed the Colts to go into halftime with a 24\u201314 lead. Two touchdown passes from Cassel, to Dwayne Bowe and Steve Breaston respectively, gave the Chiefs 21 unanswered points and completed the comeback, winning the game 28\u201324, dropping the Colts to 0\u20135 on the season.","at Paul Brown Stadium, Cincinnati, Ohio","With the Colts losing five consecutive games starting the 2011 season, Indianapolis looked to win their first game of the season against the Cincinnati Bengals.  Cincinnati opened up the game well, with a 1-yard touchdown run from Cedric Benson.  With both defenses performing well throughout the remainder of the first half with the only other scores coming on a Donald Brown touchdown run for the Colts, and a Mike Nugent field goal.  Going into halftime, the Bengals led the Colts 10\u20137.  Cincinnati dominated the third quarter on both fronts, with another Benson touchdown run and Nugent field goal, quickly running the lead up to 20\u20137 heading into the fourth quarter.  There Colts were able to strike on an Adam Vinatieri 46-yard field goal narrowing the score to 20\u201310.  A Dallas Clark touchdown reception from Curtis Painter allowed the Colts to cut the game to a 20\u201317 affair with 9:33 remaining in the fourth quarter.  After a missed Nugent field goal, with the Colts driving, Pierre Gar\u00e7on fumbled the football, giving it to Carlos Dunlap who would take the ball in for a touchdown, and ended the score, with the Bengals winning the game 27\u201317, giving the Colts an 0\u20136 record on the season.","at Mercedes-Benz Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana","In a rematch of Super Bowl XLIV on SNF, the Colts traveled to New Orleans to take on the Saints.  The Saints would quickly get on the board as Drew Brees would throw 3 touchdown passes in the quarter alone twice to Marques Colston from 14 and 4 yards out for 7\u20130 and 14\u20130 leads and once to Darren Sproles for a 21\u20130 lead.  They would eventually move ahead 31\u20130 in the 2nd quarter as Jed Collins ran for a 1-yard touchdown followed by John Kasay nailing a 23-yard field goal.  The Colts finally got on the board as Delone Carter ran for a touchdown from 2-yards out sending the game to 31\u20137.

In the 2nd half, the Saints score 4 consecutive touchdowns with Brees hooking up with Jimmy Graham on a 4-yard and 2-yard to increase their lead to 41\u20137 and then 48\u20137 in the 3rd quarter.  In the 4th quarter, Sproles ran for a 16-yard touchdown while Leigh Torrence returned an interception 42 yards for a touchdown for score of 55\u20137 and then the final score would be 62\u20137.","The Colts\u2019 loss was the most lopsided game of the 2011 NFL season and the first time a team had allowed 60 or more points since January 2000, when the Jacksonville Jaguars humiliated the Miami Dolphins 62\u20137 in the divisional round playoffs. The loss also represented the worst loss in franchise history in terms of margin (55) and points allowed (62).","The Colts would go on and drop even further down to 0\u20137.","After a huge loss at the Saints, the Colts traveled to Nashville take on the Titans.  The Titans would score 20 unanswered points in the first half alone as Rob Bironas would kick a 51-yard field goal for a 3\u20130 lead in the first quarter, and in the 2nd quarter, Jason McCourty would recover a blocked punt in the end zone sending the game to 10\u20130, followed up by Bironas nailing a 50-yard field goal for 13\u20130 and eventual halftime lead of 20\u20130 when Nate Washington ran for a 3-yard touchdown.

The victory also ended the possibility of the 2011 season becoming the first in NFL history to feature both an undefeated and winless team in one season, as the Green Bay Packers lost to the Kansas City Chiefs after a 13-0 start the same day.
