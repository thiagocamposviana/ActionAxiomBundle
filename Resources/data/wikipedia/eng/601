["Ssangbangwool Raiders (Korean:\u00a0\uc30d\ubc29\uc6b8 \ub808\uc774\ub354\uc2a4 ) was a Korea Professional Baseball team founded in 1990 and dissolved upon bankruptcy of the team's owner in 1999. They were based in the North Jeolla Province and were members of the Korea Baseball Organization. A notoriously unsuccessful team, they only made the playoffs twice in their nine-year KBO history, losing both times, never making it to the Korean Series.","The two most notable players who spent considerable time with the Raiders were designated hitter Kim Ki-tai, who won a home run title in 1994 and a batting title in 1997 (as well as being a three-time KBO League Golden Glove Award-winner with the Raiders), and Park Kyung-oan, considered by many to be one of the best catchers in Korean baseball history.","The Raiders played the 1990 season in the KBO Futures League, South Korea's second level of baseball. The team joined the KBO in 1991.","On April 30, 1993, Raiders pitcher Kim Won-hyeong threw a no-hitter, defeating the OB Bears 3\u20130 at Jeonju Baseball Stadium. At age 20, Kim was the youngest KBO pitcher to ever throw a no-hitter.[1]","Ssangbangwool suffered through a 17-game losing streak in 1999 on their way to a record of 28-97-7 and a winning percentage of .224, one of the worst seasons in KBO history. The Raiders were dissolved after the '99 season because of the bankruptcy of the Ssangbangwool Group, the team's owner. The franchise was subsumed by the KBO, which then awarded a new franchise to the SK conglomerate. The new franchise was named the SK Wyverns and they started play in 2000. The Raiders and the Wyverns have no historical links, although the new team consisted mostly of former Raiders players.","This article about a baseball team is a stub.
