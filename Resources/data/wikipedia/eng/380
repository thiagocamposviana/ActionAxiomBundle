["Breog\u00e1n (also spelt Breoghan, Bregon or Breachdan) is a character in the Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn, a medieval Christian history of Ireland and the Irish (or Gaels). He is supposedly the son of Brath,[1] and is described as an ancestor of the Gaels. The Lebor Gab\u00e1la purports to be an account of how the Gaels descend from Adam through the sons of Noah and how they came to Ireland.","It tells us that they spent 440 years wandering the Earth and underwent a series of trials and tribulations. Eventually, they sail to Iberia and conquer it. There, one of their leaders, Breog\u00e1n, founds a city called Brigantia and builds a great tower. From the top of the tower, his son \u00cdth glimpses Ireland. The Gaels, including some of Breog\u00e1n's sons, sail to Ireland from Brigantia and agree to divide it between them and the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann, the Irish pagan gods, who take the Otherworld. Brigantia likely refers to A Coru\u00f1a in present-day Galicia [2] and Breog\u00e1n's tower is likely based on the Tower of Hercules (which was built at A Coru\u00f1a by the Romans) or the Tower of Babel. The idea that the Irish Gaels came from Hispania may be based on the similarity of the names Iberia and Hibernia and the names Galicia and Gael.[3] Medieval pseudo-historians made similar claims about other nations based on their names.[4] A similar story about a monk who voyaged to a marvelous island he saw from the top of the tower of Brigantia was written in the first years of the eleventh century in Galicia. The story, preserved in two 14th-century manuscripts, is known as Trezenzonii de Solistitionis Insula Magna (\"Trezenzonius' Great Island of the Solstice\").[5]  His son was Bile, who was in turn the father of Milesius (also called M\u00edl Esp\u00e1ine, soldier of Hispania or Spain), said to be the ancestor of the Irish people. Although this is generally regarded as myth, the conquering of Ireland by people coming from the Iberian peninsula in prehistoric times fits in with a genetic study conducted in 2006 at Oxford University, which concluded that the majority of people in the British Isles are actually descended from neolithic farmers coming from the coastal north regions of Spain.[6]","The Lebor Gab\u00e1la was a hugely popular and influential work. Galicia itself is sometimes described poetically as the \"Home\" or \"Nation\" of Breog\u00e1n (in Galician, the fogar or naz\u00f3n de Breog\u00e1n). The land is so described in the anthem of Galicia, \"Os Pinos\". A large statue of Breog\u00e1n stands near the Tower of Hercules in Coru\u00f1a. The professional basketball club of the Galician city of Lugo is called CB Breog\u00e1n in its honor. In the Spanish capital Madrid, there is a park called Parque de Breog\u00e1n, named after this legendary figure.","Breog\u00e1n had nine other sons besides Bile father of Milesius. Of these, \u00cdoth came to Ireland first and was murdered by the sons of Cermait, prompting his family to arrive for revenge. \u00cdoth's son Lughaidh is commemorated in the placename Corca Luighe, and \u00cdoth's brothers in other placenames: Breogha, Cuailgne, Muirtheimhne, and Cualu in the territories of their descendant peoples; Fuad, Bladh, and Eibhle in mountains (Sliabh Fuaid in the Fews, Slieve Bloom, and Slieve Felim respectively) and N\u00e1r in \"Ros N\u00e1ir\" in Slieve Bloom and \"Cathair N\u00e1ir\" in Slieve Mish.[7]","Media related to Breog\u00e1n  at Wikimedia Commons"]
