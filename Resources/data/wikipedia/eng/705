["Sant'Antonio delle Monache a Port'Alba or Sant'Antoniello was a monastery and monastic church on Piazza Bellini in the historic city-centre of Naples, Italy. It was founded in 1564 by sister Paola Cappellani and expanded by annexing the neighbouring palazzo dei Principi di Conca to the monastery - this closed off the original facade, in which can be seen the remains of the original doorway. The present 18th century facade with a grand two-ramp staircase. The church is now owned by the University of Naples Federico II.","This article on a Catholic church building is a stub.
