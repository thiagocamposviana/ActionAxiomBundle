["The Green Line is a light rail transit (LRT) megaproject planned to run between north-central and southeastern Calgary, Alberta, Canada. When completed, it will be the third line in the CTrain system and will be known as Route 203, connecting with the existing Red Line and the Blue Line in Downtown Calgary. The Green Line is the largest public infrastructure project in the history of Alberta[4] and is three-and-a-half times bigger than the second-largest project.[5] It will be the first rail line in Calgary to operate low-floor trains.[6]","When completed, the Green Line will comprise 29 stations spanning 46 kilometres. Like the Red Line and Blue Line, the Green Line will be built in stages. Stage one of construction will feature 15 stations (9 at-grade, 4 underground, 2 elevated) and was  funded and approved by Calgary City Council on June 16, 2020.[7] Construction of stage one is expected to begin in 2022[8] and will be completed in 2027.[9] The city paused the project's procurement on December 17, 2020 after the United Conservative provincial government failed to contribute their portion of the line's funding and rebuked the project's plan. This move has delayed major construction of the project by at least one year.[10][11][12]","The Green Line will be an urban and suburban light-rail line using low-floor trains, integrated as part of Calgary's CTrain system. Like the rest of Calgary\u2019s rail transit network, the Green Line will be powered by renewable, wind generated electricity.[13] Operation of the line will be publicly funded by municipal taxation along with rider fares, and will be administered by Calgary Transit. Generally, stations will be smaller and less elaborate than existing CTrain stations, due to the use of low-floor trains. The southeast segment of the line will run similarly to the existing Red Line and Blue Line, with dedicated tracks, bells and gates on at-grade crossings and free standing stations. The track between 26 Avenue SE Station and Ramsay\/Inglewood Station is then elevated on a guideway similar to the existing Sunalta Station. The line is then completely underground with four underground stations through the Beltline, the Centre City, and Eau Claire. The underground segment begins at a tunnel portal at 11 Avenue and 6 Street SE adjacent to the Victoria Park Bus Garage. It will enter the Beltline in a shallow tunnel below 11 Avenue SE, stopping underground at 4 Street SE and Centre Street South stations before reorienting northward and entering the centre city under 2 Street SW. The train then stops underground at 7 Avenue SW Station in Calgary\u2019s urban core, providing direct transfer to the existing Red Line and Blue Line. The train will continue north, stopping underground at 2 Avenue SW Station in Eau Claire, exiting at a tunnel portal integrated into the Eau Claire Market, which will be redeveloped similar to the Central Library to accommodate the train. Then, an S-curved elevated guideway will take tracks to Centre Street, north of the Centre Street Bridge. The train will then run northward in the centre two lanes of Centre Street in a dedicated right of way, leaving two lanes for car traffic south of McKnight Boulevard and four lanes north of McKnight Boulevard. The train will run without gates, bells or fences on most at-grade crossings along Centre Street. The train will continue northward, tracks will eventually enter into the median of Harvest Hills Boulevard, and the line will eventually span north of Stoney Trail into the outer suburban community of Keystone around 2043.[14][15]","The line will run from north-central to southeast Calgary on 46 kilometres of track and will feature 29 stations. This will bring the total number of CTrain stations in Calgary to 74. The planned Green Line corridor is currently served via three bus rapid transit (BRT) routes: Route 300 (operating the Calgary International Airport and downtown, primarily along Centre Street), Route 301 (between North Pointe and downtown)[16] and Route 302 (between Seton and downtown).[17] Like the Red Line and Blue Line, the Green Line will be built in stages. Stage one of construction will extend from 16 Avenue North at 16 Avenue N Station, through downtown Calgary, to 126 Avenue SE at Shepard Station.[18]","Stage one of construction will be built incrementally in three smaller segments:[9]","Though the alignment and general design of future expansions have been approved by city council, the timeline and funding of future extensions has not yet been determined. Construction stage one builds the most complex and the most expensive segment of the line first - allowing incremental, relatively simple expansion of the line as funding becomes available. The full build-out of the line is estimated to require an additional CA$2\u20133 billion. In 2019, several potential stage two build-outs were evaluated for variable amounts of potential future funding. These were:[24]","When completed, stage one of the Green Line will feature:","When the full line is complete, it will also feature 12 bridges, 10 park and ride facilities (with 5,000 to 6,000 parking stalls), 10 tunnels (including the 4\u00a0km (2.5\u00a0mi)-long centre city tunnel from 2 St SW in Eau Claire to Olympic Way SE in Victoria Park, a bridge connecting Eau Claire to Centre Street North, and 2 LRV maintenance and storage facilities (at Shepard and 96 Avenue N).[25][14]","The megaproject is expected to have far-reaching impacts to the mobility, economics and quality of life of hundreds of thousands of Calgarians.[18] The Green Line will be entirely powered by wind generated electricity, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 67,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year, equivalent to 14,200 fewer vehicles on Calgary's roadways.[26][27]  This saves 22 million litres of gasoline and diesel fuel yearly and reduces city-wide smog by 2%.[26] Deerfoot Trail is currently the primary transportation route from north-central to southeast Calgary. It is the busiest freeway in Alberta, and suffers from chronic congestion. Calgarians spent an average of 15.7 hours in peak hour congestion in 2016.[28][29] The Green Line alignment runs adjacent to Deerfoot Trail and is expected to be a catalyst for reducing traffic on the arterial route, as well as having impacts on traffic city wide. The completed Green Line will reduce city-wide congestion by 10-15% and reduce total vehicle kilometres traveled by up to 40%.[29] Additionally, the line will reduce travel times for existing north-central BRT and southeast BRT riders by an average of 25 minutes.[18] Centre Street between 9 Avenue N -  McKnight Blvd will be reduced to two lanes for vehicle traffic, converting the road from an arterial through-road to a local street. Those wishing to travel between downtown \u2014 McKnight Blvd using Centre Street will be encouraged to ride the CTrain, or take alternate routes such as Edmonton Trail or 14 Street NW. The line will contribute towards Calgary's economic recovery in response to the COVID-19 pandemic by generating 20,000 jobs for the construction of stage one alone, and by connecting 200,000 jobs within walking distance of the route. When completed, it\u2019s expected that 140,000 people will ride the Green Line every day. Stage one of construction is expected to have a daily ridership of 65,000 people.[18]","Trams ran on the surface of Centre Street for 41 years, from 1909 to 1950.[30] The Green Line will restore the historic alignment of Calgary\u2019s trams, running trains on the surface of Centre Street as well.","The Green Line was first envisioned in 1983, two years after Calgary\u2019s first LRT line opened.[31] As early as 1986, the communities of McKenzie Towne, New Brighton and Copperfield had set aside land along 52 Street SE for the future line. In 1987, the city then conducted the Southeast Mass Transit Corridor Study and concluded that southeast Calgary would one day require a dedicated light rail line.[32]","In 2010, the city anticipated that the Green Line would be required before Calgary\u2019s population reached 1.25 million, though the city surpassed that population just 5 years later.[33] Chronic congestion on Deerfoot Trail is partly attributed to the failure to construct the Green Line before the 1.25 million population target.[34] In 2011, the city began considering three possible alignments for the north-central leg of the Green Line: along Nose Creek adjacent to Deerfoot Trail, on Edmonton Trail, or on Centre Street. After engagement with the public, the city selected Centre Street as the preferred alignment.[35] In 2012, the Green Line was proposed as two separate new lines \u2014 one from downtown to north central and one from downtown to the southeast.[36] The division of the line was rejected by council.[37] Through 2016, $101\u00a0million had been spent on right-of-way acquisition and preliminary studies.[38] In May 2017, the city revealed the line's suggested alignment and announced it would be built in stages due to the unexpectedly high costs of certain design choices.[39] Although the original estimate for the entire 28-station Green Line was $4.5\u00a0billion,[40] the cost of stage one alone, including the $1.95\u00a0billion cost of the centre city tunnel,[41] is estimated at $4.65\u00a0billion.[39]","In 2015, the Government of Canada announced that it would invest a historic $1.53 billion in the Green Line, the single largest federal investment for an infrastructure project in Alberta, ever.[42] In early 2019, Alberta\u2019s NDP provincial government committed $1.53 billion in funding paid for by the provincial carbon tax.[43] Over time, the City of Calgary set aside funding for the Green Line and has designated a $1.53 billion investment in the project. The Green Line is funded by three roughly equal contributions from all three orders of government. In late 2019, after the 2019 Alberta General Election, the newly elected United Conservative provincial government cut the Green Line\u2019s budget by 86%[44] and passed a bill allowing their government to terminate remaining funding \u201cwithout cause\u201d and with only 90 days notice.[45] This move complicated the city\u2019s ability to move forward with the project and hindered the city\u2019s access to the federal government\u2019s historic investment. The provincial government\u2019s decision has also temporarily made the City of Calgary the sole funder of the project as they do not have access federal funding until stage one of construction is complete. On May 12, 2020, the city announced changes to the alignment of the line to keep the project within budget. The revised alignment replaced the deep-earth tunnel under the Bow River with an elevated guideway over the east end of Prince's Island Park. The elimination of the tunnel under the river significantly reduces construction cost and risk. The changes also brought the line to the surface between 9 Avenue N and 16 Avenue N, running along the two centre lanes of Centre Street in a dedicated right of way. The Green Line north of 16 Avenue N has been planned as a surface running train since the city\u2019s 2017 recommendations. The changes also included the addition of 9 Avenue N Station in Crescent Heights, increasing the number of stations in stage one of construction to 15, and bringing the total number of stations to 29. 2 Avenue SW Station and 4 Street SE Station were moved from being at-grade to underground and the Beltline section of the line was moved one block north to run under 11 Avenue South, rather than under 12 Avenue South as initially recommended. The plan for a tunnel under the intersection of Barlow Trail and 114 Avenue SE was scrapped in favour of an elevated guideway over the intersection, and the park and ride at Shepard station was revised from a parkade to a surface parking lot.[46][47]","As the megaproject's approval was looming in early 2020, a group of wealthy oil industry and business executives, all with ties to the United Conservative Party,[48] organized an invite only event at the Calgary Petroleum Club with city officials.[49] Despite speculation that the group's objective was to cancel the project,[50][51] some attendees insisted otherwise.[52] One of the participants, oil industry executive Jim Gray, suggested the group was not opposed to the line but instead wanted to \"de-risk\" it.[52] The group called for replacing half of the rail line with a bus, cancelling the downtown subway, and for the use of high-floor trains.[53] The group also funded a large online social media ad campaign opposing the Green Line and hung anti-Green Line flyers in communities around the city.[54] In December 2020, the United Conservative Minister of Transportation, Ric McIver, rebuked the Green Line's alignment saying in a statement that the train is a \"line to nowhere\u201d[10] and the city does not have \"any credible plan\".[55] The United Conservative provincial government has also retained legislation allowing them to revoke their contribution with only 90 days notice and has failed to transfer their contribution to the City of Calgary. Officials say this move complicates the project\u2019s procurement, increases the project\u2019s overall cost by millions of dollars and has successfully delayed the project by at least one year.[56] Despite these actions, the provincial government maintains publicly that they support the idea of the Green Line.[57][58]","On June 16, 2020, council voted 14 to 1 to approve construction stage one of the Green Line, rejecting the group's demands to suppress the project.[9] A poll conducted that same month found 68.7% of Calgarians in support of the project with its updated 2020 alignment.[59] The CA$4.6 billion cost of Stage 1 will be shared in roughly equal portions between the federal government, provincial government, and the City of Calgary.[60]","The City of Calgary began preparing for construction in 2017 with utility relocation and environmental redemption projects along the alignment of the line and spent over $500 million.[61] The city states the project is \"shovel ready\".[10] Construction of stage one was expected to begin in 2021 and was to be completed in 2027.[9][10] On December 17, 2020 the City of Calgary \"paused\" construction procurement after the United Conservative provincial government failed to transfer their contribution of the line's funding that was committed in 2015.[11] That same day, the spokesman for the party's Minister of Transportation, Ric McIver, stated that the train is a \"line to nowhere\"[10] despite the project's popular support,[59] an overdue lack of adequate rapid transit in Calgary's north-central and southeastern communities,[33] and a projected daily ridership of 140,000 people when completed.[18] Due to the ongoing issues inflicted by the provincial government, reports surfaced in March 2021 indicating that construction is unlikely to begin in 2021 as previously planned by the city. Jeff Binks, president of the pro-LRT advocacy group \"LRT on the Green\" told reporters that \"the idea of beginning construction in 2021 has now entered the realm of fantasy\" and Mayor Naheed Nenshi advised he \"can\u2019t see a world where there will be major construction\" in 2021.[62] Mayor Nenshi also stated that the provincial government's actions delaying construction of the line will add \"tens of millions of dollars\" to the project's cost.[10]"]
