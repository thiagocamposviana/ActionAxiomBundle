["Lithium hexafluorogermanate is the inorganic compound with the formula Li2GeF6.  It forms a solid off-white deliquescent powder. When exposed to moisture, it easily hydrolyses to release hydrogen fluoride and germanium fluoride gases.[1]","Lithium hexafluorogermanate can be dissolved in a solution of Hydrogen fluoride, which forms a precipitate of Lithium fluoride.[2]","Lithium hexafluorogermanate can be used as a densification aid in the sintering of Gadolinium oxysulfide. [3][4]","Lithium hexafluorogermanate can be used as a lithium salt additive in a lithium-ion battery electrolyte.[5]"]
