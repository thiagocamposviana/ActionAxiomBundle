["The Kasina Wielka witch trial occurred in 1634 in the small rural village of Pr\u0105mnik in Krak\u00f3w, Poland. Zofia Konstancja and Agnieszka Micha\u0142owska were convicted of witchcraft. Konstancia was burned at the stake on 11 August 1634, and Micha\u0142owska was burned on 5 September 1634.","The two women were accused of using witchcraft against the Pramnik Mill belonging to the Dominican monastery in Krak\u00f3w, which resulted in damage to the Pr\u0105mnicki fields, and of causing harm to one of the monks, i.e. the Protas factor.[1]","This is the only rural witchcraft trial  that resulted in a death sentence in Poland, and one of a few in Europe.[2] The story of this accusation resembles the folk tale Mowing-Devil.","The Pramnik Mill still stands in Pr\u0105dnik Czerwony in Krak\u00f3w on Dominikana Street,[3] a historic example of a medieval watermill.[4]","This Polish history\u2013related article is a stub.
