["Schwarz und wei\u00df wie Tage und N\u00e4chte  (Black and White Like Day and Night) is a West German film from 1978 directed by Wolfgang Petersen and starring Bruno Ganz.","A scientist, who swore off playing chess after a nervous breakdown as a boy wunderkind, creates an undefeated chess program. But the Russian world champ beats Tommy Rosemund's masterwork in a televised match. So the West German mathematician becomes a top chess pro himself, which the West German media boast will prove the superiority of Germany and democracy. The jowly, white-faced Rosemund believes that the entire Red Communist bloc is out to stop him from vanquishing their atheist pretty boy, Stefan Koruga, to become the next Bobby Fischer and a symbol that capitalism is preferable to socialism.","John Simon called Black and White Like Day and Night- \"the best film ever about chess\".[1]","This article related to a German film of the 1970s is a stub.
