["\"Do You Wanna Get High?\" is a song by the American rock band Weezer, released on November 3, 2015 for the band's self-titled 2016 album.[1]","Concept-wise, \"Do You Wanna Get High?\" is about Rivers Cuomo's former addiction to prescription pills, which he did along with his girlfriend he had in 2000 and 2001.[2][3] Cuomo states \"Suddenly the song is sunny and sweet and in my mind, creatively this is when the high kicks in \u2014 everything is lovely and dreamy.\"[4] Jon Blistein of Rolling Stone compared  the song's opening feedback to that of \"No Other One\" from Pinkerton.[5] Alex Young at Consequence of Sound compared the song's \"bombastic guitar riffs and earworm hooks\" to Pinkerton.[6] Genre-wise, it has been described as an \"alt rock chugger\"[7] and a \"power pop jam\".[8]","Chris DeVille at Stereogum held the song in higher regards than the previous single, \"Thank God for Girls\", describing it as \"Pinkerton style meets Green Album quality.\"[9] Carolyn Menyes from Music Times stated \"\"Do You Wanna Get High?\" is a hard-hitting song and reminds fans that for every goofy Weezer song, there's this sort of real rock gem. And, for bonus points, there's a soaring guitar solo that brings the real hardness of this song all the way home.\"[10] At Spin, Andrew Unterberger ranked it as the 14th best post-Pinkerton Weezer song, observing \"the narcotic temptations of the lyrics give \u201cHigh\u201d a darkness and intrigue we never heard from Cuomo the first time around, thankfully keeping it from becoming cartoonish in its retro leanings.\"[7]"]
