["Melicope mucronulata is a species of plant in the family Rutaceae. It is endemic to the Hawaiian Islands.  It is threatened by habitat loss. It is a federally listed endangered species of the United States. Like other Hawaiian Melicope, this species is known as alani.[2]","This plant has been known from the islands of Maui and Molokai. The Maui population was last seen in 1983,[3] and it is probably extinct.[1] On Molokai there are only three plants left.[3]","The last individuals of the species are threatened by the coffee twig borer (Xylosandrus compactus) and habitat degradation by feral ungulates such as Axis deer.[3]","This Rutaceae article is a stub.
