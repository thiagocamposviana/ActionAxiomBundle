All we see is a film that's a hot mess of random scenes stitched together.\"[11] The Hans India gave 2 of 5 stars and stated, \"The movie doesn't have a solid story which will be the biggest minus point of this film. Director Siddharth Thatholu along with the supervision of Ram Gopal Varma focused more on the unnecessary elevations for the hero and the slow-paced narration will test the patience of the audience. The performances are decent but the story execution is very poor. The screenplay is also terrible and most of the scenes don't have any connection. Also, the violence and the bloodshed in the film will irk some sections of the audience. Especially, the second half is extremely slow and some of the scenes are just logicless\".[12]"]
