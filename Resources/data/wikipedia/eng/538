["Rosyth railway station serves the town of Rosyth in Fife, Scotland. The station is managed by Abellio ScotRail and lies on the Fife Circle Line, 14.7 miles (23.6\u00a0km) north of Edinburgh Waverley.  It was opened in 1917 by the North British Railway (as Rosyth Halt) to serve the nearby naval dockyard.","On Mondays to Saturdays during the daytime, there is generally a half-hourly service southbound to Edinburgh Waverley, and a half-hourly service northbound towards the centre of Dunfermline, continuing round the Fife Circle through Kirkcaldy, eventually coming back to Edinburgh Waverley. In the evenings the service is hourly in each direction and on Sundays two-hourly.","The basic service remains unchanged on weekdays and Saturdays (half-hourly to Edinburgh and Cowdenbeath, with hourly extensions around the full Fife Circle), but there is now an hourly service each way on Sundays.[3]","In 2013 construction began at Rosyth station to build new disabled access points, so that people with wheelchairs and buggies can make their way onto the platform.[4] There are also plans for a new transport hub to be built at Rosyth, with 500 car park spaces, a bus stance and taxi rank.","This Scotland railway station-related article is a stub.
