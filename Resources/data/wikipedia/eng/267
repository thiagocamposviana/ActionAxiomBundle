["Affrilachia is a term that focuses on the cultural contributions of African American artists, writers, and musicians in the Appalachian region of the United States.[1] The term \"Affrilachia\" is attributed to Kentucky-based writer Frank X Walker, who began using it in the 1990s as a way to negate the stereotype of Appalachian culture,[1][2] which portrays Appalachians as predominantly white and living in small mountain communities.[3] Walker is also the man who jump started Affrilachia, and could be said to have made this word global.[4] The term Affrilachian stands for an African American who is a native or is a resides in the Appalachian region.[5] Affrilachia is also the title of Walker's 2000 book of poetry, published by Old Cove Press.[6]","Frank X Walker co-founded The Affrilachian Poets and in 2009, created The Affrilachian Journal of Arts and Culture.[7] Frank X Walker is a graduate of the University of Kentucky, currently serves as an associate professor in the UK Department of English.[8] Walker\u2019s partnership with the University of Kentucky allowed him to also create and teach an educational program on African-American and Africana studies, which further contributed to and raised awareness of Affrilachian art, culture, and history.[9] The word \"Affrilachia\" is included in the second edition of the Oxford American Dictionary.[10]","In 2011, Marie T. Cochran created the Affrilachian Artist Project with the goal of building a sustainable collaborative network among the region\u2019s artists and community organizers.[2] Today the project has over 2,000 members and has organized several Affrilachian-themed art exhibitions.","More than thirty prominent art community members, which includes writers, musicians, and artists identify as Affrilachian, including: Frank X Walker, Nikky Finney, Kelly Norman, Ellis, Mitchell L. H. Douglas, Crystal Wilkinson, Bianca Spriggs, Parneshia Jones, and Ellen Hagan.[11] As of March 2021, 3,028 people currently follow the Affrilachian Artist Project's Facebook page.[2]","Frank X Walker has made the books Issac Murphy: I Dedicate This Ride, which is a poem about Issac Murphy.

No music has been more influential in the Appalachian region than the music that is made surrounding the banjo. The banjo is considered and Appalachian icon when it comes to music. West African enslaved musicians had brought over many musical instruments including the banjo to the New World [15]","Affrilachian food and cuisine has slight variations from region to region, just like the rest of Appalachian culture. Some of the stables across Affrilachian cuisine are the practices of preserving produce through pickling, fermenting, and canning as well as drying out other crops such as beans and corn.[16] Many of the food that is eaten is the different Appalachian regions are the crops that families could grow themselves or trade for at local markets. Another Affrilachian stable is the style of pan-frying many different dishes using butter as opposed to neutral oils. Rufus Estes has differentiated his fried chicken from many others using the \"pan-fried in butter\" method.","Melinda Russel has been coined as an influential member of Affrilachia because of the cookbook she published and her \"Washington Cake\" that gained fame from its combination of citrus and spiced flavors.[17]","This article about popular culture is a stub.
