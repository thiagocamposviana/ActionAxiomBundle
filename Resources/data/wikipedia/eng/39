To the east of the city the higher mountains of the Andes rise above the city, thrusted upwards by the north\u2013south-trending Bucaramanga-Santa Marta Fault, one of the major megaregional faults of Colombia. The area is dominated by the Bucaramanga Nest, the second-most seismically active region in the world.[6] Because of the relatively low altitude, the city enjoys a very favorable climate all year round. Floridablanca's climate is classified as tropical. When compared with winter, the summers have much more rainfall. The climate is classified as Aw (tropical savanna climate) by the K\u00f6ppen-Geiger system. The average annual temperature is 23.6\u00a0\u00b0C (74.5\u00a0\u00b0F) in Floridablanca.

The Guane were submitted to the rule of the Spanish Empire by conquistador Mart\u00edn Galeano when he founded V\u00e9lez in 1539, until then part of the Muisca Confederation. Modern Floridablanca was founded on November 7, 1817 as \"Floridablanca de San Juan Nepomuceno\" by Javier Guerra de Mier.[10] The church of San Juan Nepomuceno finished construction in 1832.[11]","According to official DANE census, Floridablanca has 262,165 inhabitants, being the second most populated city in Santander. 47,37% are men, while 52,63% are women. 95,6% of the population over 5 years know how to write and read, meaning, illiteracy rate is about 4,4%.","Statistics show that most of the adult people living in the city are from Bucaramanga:","A study performed in 1998 provided data on the economical activities in Floridablanca, that has grown since those times. Commerce was the most important sector with 39% of the economical make-up, industrial production of clothing was nearly 10% and the food and drinks industry comprised 7% of the economical activities.[12] The production of sweets, and especially the traditional Colombian dessert of obleas, has given Floridablanca the name \"the sweet municipality of Colombia\".[13]","The central part of the city hosts a concentration of malls; Ca\u00f1averal, constructed in 1984,[14] and Parque Caracol\u00ed, inaugurated in 2013.[15]","The city, in recent years grown to connect with Bucaramanga, forms the entry point to the Chicamocha Canyon, located at an hour drive from the city, and hosts touristic activities with a paragliding school on the Mesa de Ruitoque, the Ruitoque Massif in the southwest of the city.[16] Local buses to tourist hotspots as San Gil and the Chicamocha Canyon leave from a transport station called \"Papi Quiero Pi\u00f1a\" (\"Dad, I want pineapple\").[17] The Jard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico Eloy Valenzuela, a botanical garden in Floridablanca, was once owned by the El Parag\u00fcitas tobacco company.[2] In 2017, the city was designated by the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism as one of five \"sustainable touristic destinations\" of Colombia.[18]","Some of the schools located in Floridablanca are:"]
