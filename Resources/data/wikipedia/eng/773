Following his graduation, Robertson taught music at North Cache High School in Richmond, Utah and at Pleasant Grove High School in Pleasant Grove, Utah, where he also supervised music in the Alpine School District.","Robertson was appointed to the music faculty at Brigham Young University in 1925.

He would continue his studies with Bloch in Roveredo Capriasca, Switzerland in 1932, and with Hugo Leichtentritt in Berlin, Germany, in 1933. Robertson received a BA degree and an MA degree from Brigham Young University in June 1933.","Between 1933-1945 Robertson composed several works for piano and organ, as well as strings, including \"Songs from the Shadow\", \"Fantasia for the Organ\", \"String Quartet\" and \"Punch and Judy\". It was also during this period that he began work on the \"Oratorio from the Book of Mormon\". In 1945, Robertson was awarded the Utah Institute of Fine Arts Award for \"Rhapsody for  Piano and Orchestra\". Robertson won the Reichhold Award of $25,000 for \"Trilogy for Orchestra\" in 1947, which was premiered by the Detroit Symphony Orchestra with Karl Krueger conducting.

Robertson's \"Concerto for Violin and Orchestra\" premiered under Maurice Abravanel during the centennial of the University of Utah in 1950 with Utah Symphony Orchestra's concertmaster Tibor Zelig as soloist.[2]  In 1954, he received his Ph.D from the University of Southern California.","Robertson was instrumental in the promotion of the Utah Symphony and of classical music in Salt Lake City.","He is best known for his Oratorio from the Book of Mormon, which premiered in 1953.
