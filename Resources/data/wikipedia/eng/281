["The 2013 Houston Baptist Huskies football team represented Houston Baptist University in the 2013 NCAA Division I FCS football season. The Huskies, playing their first season of collegiate football, were led by first year head coach Vic Shealy.[1] However, they were not considered a FCS team for scheduling purposes until 2014. They played three home games at Crusader Stadium and one home game at BBVA Compass Stadium. This was an exhibition season for the Huskies. The season did not count against the players academic eligibility, but they also were not eligible for the FCS playoffs. As a result, they played a mixed schedule of schools from the FCS, NAIA, and D-II. They finished the season 3\u20134.","The Huskies joined the Southland Conference for the 2014 season and then became immediately eligible for the Southland Championship and for the FCS Playoffs.[2]","All Houston Baptist games were streamed online by the Legacy Sports Network,"]
