There he had stable employment working for the Estates Theatre in Prague from 1846 to 1861 where he was also in charge of lighting. He returned to Linz in 1868 where he stayed until 1872. He moved to Brno in 1873 where he was also the theatrical engineer.[1]","He had five children: Floriana Jaichov\u00e1, Wilhelmina Kautsk\u00e1 (Jaichov\u00e1), Louisa Jaichov\u00e1, Viktor Jaich, and Anton Jaich.
