["Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) is an American company headquartered in Reston, Virginia[7] that provides government services and information technology support.","The original SAIC was created in 1969 by J. Robert Beyster. Then on September 27, 2013, it spun off a $4\u00a0billion unit which retained its name,[8] while the parent company changed its name to Leidos. Following the split, Anthony J. Moraco was appointed CEO of SAIC, and John P. Jumper was appointed CEO of Leidos.[9]  The primary motivation for the spinoff was the conflicts of interest provisions in the Federal Acquisition Regulation which prevented the company from bidding on some new contracts because of existing contracts.[10][11]","On May 4, 2015, SAIC acquired Scitor Holdings, Inc. for $790\u00a0million to expand their presence in the intelligence industry through classified contracts, cleared personnel, and a robust security infrastructure.[12] Scitor was previously owned by Leonard Green & Partners, L.P., a private equity firm.[13]","On September 10, 2018, SAIC announced its acquisition of Engility, a competitor in the U.S. government services contracting sector, for a combined US$2.5\u00a0billion with the merger set to take place in January 2019.[14]","On February 6, 2020, SAIC announced its acquisition of UNISYS US Federal, a competitor in the U.S. government services contracting sector, for a combined US$1.2 billion.","SAIC has adopted a matrix operating model in which different service lines collaborate to serve a given contract.[11][15]","Deborah Lee James, president of SAIC's technology and engineering sector, was sworn in as Secretary of the Air Force on December 20, 2013, after being appointed by President Barack Obama.","This United States corporation or company article is a stub.
