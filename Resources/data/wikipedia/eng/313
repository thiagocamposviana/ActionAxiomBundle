Kent Wolgamott of Lincoln Journal Star said the film tells the war-torn story of the DRC through \"the testimony of four people, vintage news clips and raw, riveting footage from the battlefields and displaced person camps\".[11] In The London Economic, journalist Wyndham Hacket Pain opined that although the documentary \"may tell a story that is familiar from new reports and articles, it has rarely been told in such a meditative and poetic manner.\"[12] David D'Arcy of Screen Daily commended McCabe for presenting the DRC story with a \"grim element of surprise\", but ended up saying the documentary's multiple perspectives \"can feel lopsided\".[13] Reviewing for International Policy Digest, David Ferguson said This Is Congo was \"beautifully photographed, and perfectly captures the often stunning landscape between violent bursts of war and personal fright\".[14]"]
