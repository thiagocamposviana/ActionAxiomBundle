["Bauer City 3 was a network of 12 popular mainstream music radio stations in Scotland and northern England, owned and operated by Bauer Radio.","From Monday 19 January 2015, The Hits on DAB was absorbed into the new Bauer City 3 network of stations.[1]  The new services were locally branded and identified, with the opportunity to split for individual local news, information, advertising and jingles, with The Hits content as a national programme feed.","Programming was broadcast among all Bauer City 3 stations in Scotland and Northern England, originating from the studios of Key 3 in Castlefield and Clyde 3 in Glasgow. Some other output was broadcast from Bauer's London Studios at Golden Square, Soho.","From 1 September 2017, the local City 3 branding of the stations on DAB was withdrawn, in favour of reverting to using The Hits name in all areas.[2]"]
