She was a cousin of the poet Endre Ady.","By then a widow, Mariska Ady wrote poems during the First World War, on the horrors of the war. Her poems first appeared in local magazines in Szil\u00e1gy County and later in Transylvanian and national periodicals and newspapers.[4] She followed the lead of her cousin, Endre Ady, in some of the aspects of her lyric poetry. She was the only other member of the Ady family to take up literature.[5]","Ady was the daughter of S\u00e1ndor Ady, a notary public in Hadad (today Hodod). She qualified as an elementary-school teacher in Budapest. In the First World War she lost her husband, Lajos Landt, which left her with three children to bring up alone. Her teaching career ended early due to illness.[5]","This article about a Hungarian writer or poet is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it."]
