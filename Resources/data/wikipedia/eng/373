["In mathematics, particularly in order theory, a pseudocomplement is one generalization of the notion of complement. In a lattice L with bottom element 0, an element x \u2208 L is said to have a pseudocomplement if there exists a greatest element x* \u2208 L, disjoint from x, with the property that x \u2227 x* = 0. More formally, x* = max{ y \u2208 L | x \u2227 y = 0 }. The lattice L itself is called a pseudocomplemented lattice if every element of L is pseudocomplemented. Every pseudocomplemented lattice is necessarily bounded, i.e. it has a 1 as well. Since the pseudocomplement is unique by definition (if it exists), a pseudocomplemented lattice can be endowed with a unary operation * mapping every element to its pseudocomplement; this structure is sometimes called a p-algebra.[1][2] However this latter term may have other meanings in other areas of mathematics.","In a p-algebra L, for all x, y \u2208 L:[1][2]","The set S(L) \u225d { x** | x \u2208 L } is called the skeleton of L.  S(L) is a \u2227-subsemilattice of L and together with x \u222a y = (x\u2228y)** = (x* \u2227 y*)* forms a Boolean algebra (the complement in this algebra is *).[1][2] In general, S(L) is not a sublattice of L.[2] In a distributive p-algebra, S(L) is the set of complemented elements of L.[1]","Every element x with the property x* = 0 (or equivalently, x** = 1) is called dense. Every element of the form x \u2228 x* is dense. D(L), the set of all the dense elements in L is a filter of L.[1][2] A distributive p-algebra is Boolean if and only if D(L) = {1}.[1]","A relative pseudocomplement of a with respect to b is a maximal element c such that a\u2227c\u2264b. This binary operation is denoted a\u2192b. A lattice with the pseudocomplement for each two elements is called implicative lattice, or Brouwerian lattice. In general, an implicative lattice may not have a minimal element. If such a minimal element exists, then each pseudocomplement a* could be defined using relative pseudocomplement as a \u2192 0.[3]"]
