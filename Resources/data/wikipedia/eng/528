["J\u00f8rgen Flood (28 December 1792 \u2013 28 June 1867) was a Norwegian merchant and politician.[1]","J\u00f8rgen Flood was born in 1792 to merchant Peder J\u00f8rgensen Flood (1756\u20131832) and Inger J\u00f8rgine J\u00f8rgensen (1769\u20131843), n\u00e9e Wesselstoft. He had ten brothers and sisters.[2] They grew up in Skien, but J\u00f8rgen later moved to Eidanger. Following the death of his wife Hanna in 1863, J\u00f8rgen moved to Grimstad. He died in that city.[1]","He had married Hanna Aall, daughter of Constitutional founding father J\u00f8rgen Aall, in 1818. They had seven children, the most prominent being J\u00f8rgen Aall Flood and Fritz Trampe Flood. In addition, their youngest daughter Constance married long-time mayor Niels Mathiesen.[1]","Together with his brother Elias Marthinius, J\u00f8rgen Flood ran the merchant company I. & E. M. Flood,[3] dealing with grain, tobacco and manufactured goods.[1] One of their outlets, the so-called Floodebutik (Flood shop) was \"visited by the most distinguished public of the Skiensfjorden\", according to one historian.[2] J\u00f8rgen Flood also bought Bolvig iron works in 1841,[1] and was also consul.[2]","In 1837, when local governance was established in Norway, Flood became the first mayor of Porsgrund municipality. He also held that position in the years 1838 and 1841. He also served as vice mayor in 1839 and 1840, under consul Jens Gasmann who started as deputy mayor.[4] Another of J\u00f8rgen's brothers, merchant Paulus Flood, served as mayor in 1845.[3][4]"]
