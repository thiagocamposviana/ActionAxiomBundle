["Honn\u014d-ji (\u672c\u80fd\u5bfa )  is a temple of the Nichiren branch of Buddhism located in Kyoto, Japan. Its honzon is mandara-honzon (\u66fc\u837c\u7f85\u672c\u5c0a) from Namu My\u014dh\u014d Renge Ky\u014d.","Honn\u014d-ji is most famous for the Honn\u014d-ji incident \u2013 the assassination of Oda Nobunaga \u2013  that occurred there on 21 June 1582. Nobunaga lodged at the temple with little protection before his invasion of the west, but was betrayed by his general Akechi Mitsuhide, whose forces surrounded the temple and set it on fire. Knowing there was no way out for him, Nobunaga committed seppuku along with his attendant Mori Ranmaru.[1] Ranmaru's brothers also perished at Honn\u014d-ji.","In 1591, Nobunaga's successor Toyotomi Hideyoshi ordered the reconstruction of Honn\u014d-ji, but on a different site due to the tragic circumstances. Honn\u014d-ji was rebuilt on its current location in present-day Nakagy\u014d Ward near Kyoto Shiyakusho-mae Station.","This article about a Japanese religious building or structure is a stub.
