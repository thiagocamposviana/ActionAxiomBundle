["The Bedford CF was a range of full-size panel vans produced by Bedford. The van was introduced in 1969 to replace the CA model, and was sized to compete directly with the Ford Transit, which had entered production four years earlier. Its design was similar to its American counterpart, the Chevrolet Van (1971-1995).","Bedford was a General Motors subsidiary, and in some markets outside the United Kingdom and Ireland the CF was sold through Opel dealers as the Opel Bedford Blitz from 1973 on when the original Opel Blitz was phased out. In other markets such as in Norway the CF retained its original name.[1]","The CF was notable for being the last solely Vauxhall-engineered vehicle when it was discontinued in 1987 (the last Vauxhall passenger car had been the HC Viva which had ceased production in 1979); since all Vauxhall models by that point had switched to being based on Opel platforms. The Bedford brand continued on certain badge engineered light van designs from Isuzu and Suzuki, before being retired in 1991.","Introduced November 1969[2] to replace the 17-year-old Bedford CA, the CF van variants soon became some of the most popular light commercial vehicles on British roads.[3][4]","The CF could be specified with a sliding door in the side panel directly behind the passenger door,[2] and it was generally with this layout that the van was also commonly used as a base vehicle for a caravanette.[5]","The engine was the well-proven Slant Four engine which was introduced for the Vauxhall FD Victor models in 1967. Apart from an increased engine capacity from 1.6\u00a0l (1,598\u00a0cc) to 1.8\u00a0l (1,759\u00a0cc) units and from 2.0\u00a0l (1,975\u00a0cc) to 2.3\u00a0l (2,279\u00a0cc) in 1972, the power units remained unchanged. A four-cylinder 1.8\u00a0l (1,760\u00a0cc) Perkins diesel engine could be specified for an extra GB\u00a3130 (1969),[2] while a larger 2.5\u00a0l (2,523\u00a0cc) version was used for heavier versions. These units were rated at 50 and 61\u00a0PS (37 and 45\u00a0kW; 49 and 60\u00a0hp) DIN. In 1976, a 2.1\u00a0l (2,064\u00a0cc) overhead valve (OHV) diesel engine from Opel replaced the outdated Perkins units.","In Australasian markets, the CF could be optioned with Holden six-cylinder units, in 2,850\u00a0cc (173.9\u00a0cu\u00a0in) and 3,310\u00a0cc (202.0\u00a0cu\u00a0in) forms. This was as an answer to the rival Ford Transit range, which in Australia used six-cylinder engines from the Ford Falcon.","The Bedford used the same basic suspension lay-out as the Vauxhall Victor, though married to greater wheel arch clearances and calibrated for greater weight carrying capacity.[6] The front independent suspension featured a double wishbone layout with coil springs and telescopic shock absorbers, while the rear wheels were suspended by a combination involving a live axle and traditional long single-leaf springs.[2]","Several different manual transmissions were used, namely the Vauxhall three-speed, four-speed, Bedford four-speed, ZF four-speed, ZF five-speed, and the General Motors automatic. The Laycock type of overdrive was available to order or on the later Vauxhall four-speed models.[5]","There were three CF1 body styles. A standard panel van which was intended to rival the Ford Transit; the special van body (essentially a self-contained cab with a general-purpose chassis onto which a wide range of custom-built bodies or beds could be built), and the Dormobile (caravanette).","The CF series 1 facelift was introduced in 1980, introducing the 2.3\u00a0L (2,260\u00a0cc) Opel 23D diesel engine with 61\u00a0hp (45.5\u00a0kW).[7]","Units exported to Germany (Bedford Blitz) received a smaller, 2.0\u00a0L (1,998\u00a0cc) diesel, producing 60\u00a0PS (44\u00a0kW; 59\u00a0hp).[8] This engine was also installed in many other export markets where tax categories suited engines with less than two litres of displacement, such as the BeNeLux countries and Finland. The 1.8 and 2.3\u00a0litre petrol units remained the same.","The restyled front end was engineered so that by removing 8 bolts the whole front panel could be completely removed, providing easy access to the engine so it could be removed from the front instead of from underneath like on the CF1.","(The CF1 \"facelift\" is often confused with being a CF2 because it's difficult to tell them apart from the exterior. The easiest visual check is that the CF facelift will have the same old metallic door handles and mirrors as the CF1 while on the CF2 have new plastic ones.)","In 1984 the CF was renamed CF2 and basically only received mechanical upgrades. The diesel engines remained the 2.3 (with the 2.0 available in continental Europe) but the old Vauxhall slant fours were replaced by a 2.0\u00a0L (1,979\u00a0cc), 78\u00a0hp (58\u00a0kW) version of the  Opel CIH four cylinder.[7]","In 1985 the CF2 was sold side by side in UK with the Bedford Midi - a smaller, badge engineered version of the Isuzu Fargo which was locally built at the newly established IBC Vehicles venture with Isuzu.","By then the CF's replacement was put on hold and then ultimately dropped when Bedford decided that rebadging other GM owned brands was much cheaper. The last CF2s were sold in the UK in 1987 and marked the end of original Bedford designed vehicles.[9]","One noteworthy variant, the CF Electric was introduced in 1982.  It was the first mass-produced electrically powered vehicle based on a fossil fuel vehicle platform. It was built in partnership between Bedford, Lucas, Chloride Group and the UK Government on a 5-year grant scheme. The batteries were housed in a compartment below the floor and the traction came from a motor placed at the rear with a step down reduction gearbox coupled to the CF's standard differential, but turned through 180'. The motor control system was housed under the bonnet and a small diesel heater provided cabin heating. The system also featured regenerative braking, however this could be turned off as it was found that in wet conditions the motor could lock the rear wheels up in a similar way as applying the handbrake. Most were sold to government agencies, the  Royal Mail and local authorities. However, with a price tag much higher than a standard CF, and battery technology at the time not advancing the government scheme wound down in 1987, and the model was withdrawn and spares for it soon dried up.","The Bedford CF van was the second most popular van in the UK, second only to the Ford Transit. Along with the Transit, the CF was usefully wider than competitor vehicles from Austin-Morris, Rootes and Volkswagen.[10]  It was also the most common caravanette.  CFs were popular with customisers throughout the 1970s and 1980s.","The Bedford CF was widely used. The British police, in particular, used them for prisoner transport and as riot vans. They were also used by the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na (Republic of Ireland police).[11][12] Some ambulance services kept them in service for longer than usual after production ended as they were liked by crews. The British Military also had a fleet of CFs. They were used by builders and builders' merchants, as well as by courier services and the Post Office. They were also a popular caravanette due to their space and reasonable fuel consumption. They were used as ice cream vans in Britain[5] and Australia.","A heavily modified CF was used as the Mystery Machine in Scooby-Doo: The Movie 2002.","A Bedford CF in use as an ice cream van in Brisbane, Australia","4390\u00a0lb.
