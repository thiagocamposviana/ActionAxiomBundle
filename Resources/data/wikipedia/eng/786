["Gaurisiam or Guru Sham (Bengali: \u0997\u09cc\u09b0\u09c0 \u09b6\u09be\u09ae ) (Meitei: \uabd2\uabe7\uabd4\uabe4 \uabc1\uabed\uabcc\uabe5\uabdd ) (18th century CE - 1763) was a Manipuri King who ruled between 1756 and 1763.[1] He was the brother of Ching-Thang Khomba, King of Manipur. He died an early death. His reign was alternated with Ching-Thang Khomba's due to Gaurisiam's physical deficiencies. Certain events demanded the presence of a healthy and hale King, and during those times his rule was intertwined with his brothers.","This biography of a member of an Indian royal house is a stub.
