["Ali Dav\u0101ni(Persian: \u0639\u0644\u06cc \u062f\u0648\u0627\u0646\u06cc) was an Iranian scholar and researcher, working in the fields of anthropology, bibliography and history.","Dav\u0101ni was born on 27 September 1929 in Davan, a village located at the north of Kazerun. He left his village to Abadan aged six. He went to Holy Najaf when he was 14 and returned to his birthplace after five years of study. He went to Qom to complete his education in 1949 after his marriage. He was subsequently granted the super ordinate rank of All\u0101meh Tab\u0101tab\u0101'i, Ayatollah Borujerdi and Imam Khomeini in Qom too.","As well as scholarship, Dav\u0101ni was involved in establishing the scientific and religious magazine of Maktab-e Islam, and writing Ayatollah Vahid Behbah\u0101ni's biography, on the encouragement of Ayatollah Borujerdi. He also translated the 13th Volume of Beh\u0101r-ul Anv\u0101r into Persian about Imam Mahdi.","In 1971, following some disputes that led to his colleagues at Maktab-e Islam magazine leaving Qom, Dav\u0101ni moved from Qom to Tehran, to continue his mission as an \"inheritor of the prophets\"."]
