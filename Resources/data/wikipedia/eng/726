Their base was at Obsdale House, situated just north of the town of Alness in the Scottish Highlands.[1] Some of the members of the Munro of Obsdale family were  amongst the most distinguished Scottish military officers of the 17th century.[2]","George Munro, 1st of Obsdale was the fourth son of Robert Mor Munro, 15th Baron of Foulis, chief of the Clan Munro.[2] However, George was the first son born from Robert's second marriage to Kathrine Ross, daughter of the chief of Clan Ross. George received the lands of Obsdale in Alness, as his patrimony. George married a distant relative, Catherine Munro, fifth daughter of Andrew Munro, 5th of Milntown, with issue, among others:[2]","John Munro, 2nd of Obsdale, like his younger and more distinguished brother General Robert Monro, adopted a military profession and served on the Continent under Gustavus Adolphus during the Thirty Years' War.[2] The brothers took ship from Cromarty on 10 October 1626 and on arrival were joined by that King's army. John Munro soon attained the rank of Colonel, and in 1628 returned to Scotland to recruit his regiment.[2]","On 14 May 1630 John Munro is one of the jury in the general service at Inverness, of John Gordon, 13th Earl of Sutherland, chief of Clan Sutherland, as heir to William, the first Earl.[2] Amongst other members of the Clan Munro present were: Robert Munro of Assynt, John Munro of Lemlair, Hector Munro of Findon, and Andrew Munro of Novar. At the same time and place the same Earl was served heir by the same jury to John de Moravia, 9th Earl of Sutherland.[2]","John Munro returned to Germany in 1630 accompanied by a considerable number of his clansmen.[2] One of the most notable incidents of John Munro, 2nd of Obsdale's career during this war was a severe engagement at the pass in Oldenburg, where he distinguished himself highly and escaped unhurt, while his brother Robert was wounded in the knee.[6] For the next three years he commanded a Scots regiment under Gustavus Adolphus. John Munro, 2nd of Obsdale was killed at Wetteraw on the Rhine, on 11 March 1633.[2] Historian Sir Robert Gordon said of him that \"he was a man imbued with many good points, and by his industry and venture purchased to himself and to his children good means and possessions under the Earl of Sutherland's wings.\"[2]","John had married Catherine, daughter of John Gordon of Embo with issue:","John Munro, 3rd of Obsdale followed in his father's footsteps of a military career and attained the rank of Captain. However, he drowned at sea in 1639 and was succeeded by his younger brother Robert.[2]","Robert Munro, 4th of Obsdale was MP for the county of Inverness in 1649 and in the same year succeeded his cousin Sir Hector Munro, 2nd Baronet (of Foulis, chief of Clan Munro) as the Parliamentary representative for Ross-shire.[2] On the death of his cousin Sir Hector in December 1651 Robert Munro, 4th of Obsdale succeeded as the nearest surviving male descendant of Robert Mor Munro, 15th Baron of Foulis as not only chief of the Clan Munro but also as Baronet of Foulis. After Sir Hector, 11th baronet died in 1935 the chieftaincy passed to his daughter and was separated from the baronetcy. From 1954, the baronets were styled \"of Foulis-Obsdale\" to distinguish their Arms and Designation from those of Munro of Foulis.[8] See article: Munro baronets for further generations.[2]","The Obsdale title was later used by another member of the same Munro family in the 18th century; the younger brother of Sir Robert Munro, 6th Baronet was Dr Duncan Munro who was styled \"of Obsdale\".[9][10] They died together at the Battle of Falkirk Muir in 1746.[10]"]
