["Oberkampf (French pronunciation:\u00a0\u200b[\u0254b\u025b\u0281k\u0251\u0303f] ) is a station of the Paris M\u00e9tro, serving Line 5 and Line 9 and located in the 11th arrondissement of Paris.","The station was opened on 15 January 1907, a month after the opening of the extension of line 5 from Quai de la Rap\u00e9e to Lancry (now called Jacques Bonsergent) on 17 December 1906. The line 9 platforms were opened on 10 December 1933 with the extension of the line from Richelieu - Drouot to Porte de Montreuil. The name refers to Rue Oberkampf, named for Christophe-Philippe Oberkampf, an 18th-century German-born French industrialist.","The station has four accesses, all of which consist of fixed stairs:","The platforms for the two lines are of standard configuration, two at each stop point, separated by the metro tracks in the centre and the arch is elliptical.","Line 5 is decorated in the style used for most metro stations: the lighting strips are white and rounded in the Gaudin style of the 2000s Metro revival, and white bevelled ceramic tiles cover walls, spandrels and outlets in the corridors. The vault is coated and painted white. The advertising frames are in a white ceramics and the name of the station is written in Parisine typeface on enamelled plates. The seats are Akiko style yellow.","The platforms of line 9 are arranged in a similar style. The lighting strips are of the same model, and the white ceramic tiles cover the walls, the spandrels as well as the outlets of the corridors, but also the vault. In contrast, the advertising frames are in a faience honey colour and the name of the station is also faience, in the original CMP style. The seats are Motte style orange.","The station is served by lines 56 and 96 of the RATP Bus Network; and, at night, by the lines N01 (inner circular starting from the Gare de l'Est) and N02 (circular outside starting from the Gare Montparnasse) of the Noctilien bus network.","This article related to the Paris M\u00e9tro is a stub.
