["Choga (Korean:\u00a0\ucd08\uac00 ; Hanja:\u00a0\u8349\u5bb6 ) denotes one of two traditional nature-friendly house types in Korea. The main building materials used to build these houses are straw, wood and soil.[1][2]","Choga roofs were especially popular among farmers and low-income classes in traditional Korean society.[3] Certain plants, such as gourds and pumpkins, could be grown on top of Choga roofs. One of the major disadvantages of the materials used, in particular rice straw, was that it could rot quickly when exposed to the elements.[4]","This architecture-related article is a stub.
