["Weikerlsee is a pair of recreational lakes just south of the confluence of the Traun and the Danube in the urban district of Ebelsberg. It includes the bathing lake, a green belt, some parking spaces, toilets, a snack bar and a nudist area on the north bank of the smaller of the two lakes. A canal joins the smaller and the larger lakes. To the south of the Larger Weiklsee are the rainwater drainage basins for the Linz sewage network.","The two lakes have a combined water surface of 21 hectares (52 acres). The larger lake is 7 metres (23\u00a0ft) lower than the smaller lake.","The smaller lake was enlarged at the beginning of the 21st century. A bridge with a viewing platform separates the northern nudist area from the southern textile beach. On the south bank is a snack bar with toilets. Bathing is strictly forbidden in the larger lake  because it is a nature reserve. Both lakes have a low water temperature due to the groundwater sources.","This Austrian location article is a stub.
