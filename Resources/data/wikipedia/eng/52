The hall is a Grade I listed building. From 1847 until 1996, the grounds of the hall contained the fa\u00e7ade of a 14th century chapel on the front of a boathouse, which was a Grade II* listed building.","Kettlethorpe Hall is a Georgian house on the outskirts of Wakefield, built by the Pilkington family[1][2] It is a two-storey building constructed of stone, and contains Doric columns.[1] The house underwent multiple renovations in the 19th century.[3] The first floor keystone showed the date of construction as 1727.[3]","In 1847, the fa\u00e7ade of the 14th century[4] Chantry Chapel (also known as the Sentry Chapel) on Wakefield Bridge was moved to Kettlethorpe Hall, and the original restored.  The fa\u00e7ade was attached to a boathouse folly,[5][6] beside the hall's artificial lake.[6] In 1859, the folly was temporarily used as a mortuary.[6][7] In the West Riding of Yorkshire volume of Pevsner Architectural Guides, Nikolaus Pevsner described the boathouse as \"the most precious of all boat houses\".[7]","In 1950, Kettlethorpe Hall was purchased by Wakefield Council, and was used as a retirement home until 1983. In 1988, the hall was bought by Yorkshire Preservation Trust, who converted it into two separate houses. Wakefield Council still owned the grounds surrounding the hall.[8] In 1996, the remains of the boathouse were removed from the grounds of Kettlethorpe Hall by Wakefield Council, who put it into storage.[5][4] The remaining stones of the boathouse became a scheduled monument, and in 2014, they were put into the secret garden at Thornes Park in Wakefield.[4][7] The stones were erected at an angle to make them easier to view.[7]","Nowadays, the house is privately owned, but the grounds are a public park.[5] In 1953, Kettlethorpe Hall became a Grade I listed building.[3] The boathouse is separately listed as a Grade II* listed building.[9]"]
