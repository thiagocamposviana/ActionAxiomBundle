["Maill\u00e9-Br\u00e9z\u00e9 is a T 47-class destroyer (escorteur d'escadre) of the French Navy. She was built by Arsenal de Lorient in Lorient, commissioned on 4 May 1957 and named after the French admiral Jean Armand de Maill\u00e9-Br\u00e9z\u00e9 (1619\u20131646).","On 2 March 1962, Maill\u00e9-Br\u00e9z\u00e9, along with another four destroyers, landed fresh troops at Algiers to fight the OAS upsurge.[2] Assisted by her sister ship Surcouf, she was about to shell the OAS-held quarter of Bab-el-Oued when a counter-order called the operation off. The destroyers instead took battle stations close to the shore as a deterrent.[3]","In 1988 she was decommissioned and became a museum ship in Nantes. She has been listed as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture since October 1991.[4]","On 21 February 2016, director Christopher Nolan announced plans to feature the ship in his upcoming World War II film Dunkirk.[5] In the film, she portrayed two British destroyers \u2013 sister ships HMS\u00a0Vivacious and HMS\u00a0Vanquisher \u2013 by simultaneously carrying the D36 pennant number of Vivacious on her port side and Vanquisher&#39; s pennant D54 on her starboard side.[6]","Coordinates: 47\u00b012\u203224\u2033N  1\u00b034\u203218\u2033W   \ufeff \/ \ufeff 47.20667\u00b0N 1.57167\u00b0W \ufeff \/ 47.20667; -1.57167"]
