The critical reaction at first was varied. V. Boichevsky in an article \"How Stories For Children Should Not Be\" saw it as a \"sugarcoated\" presentation of revolution. Anatoly Lunacharsky, however, saw in it \"heart-felt apologetics by the artistic intelligentsia accepting the revolution\".[citation needed ]","Konstantin Stanislavki and the Moscow Art Theatre premiered a dramatic version of the story in May 1930. A ballet version with music by V. Oransky was presented in 1935. It has also been turned into an opera (composer, V. Rubin, 1956), a film, cartoon movies, diafilm (filmstrip), several comic versions, several radio versions, and a computer game.[citation needed ]","This article about a 1920s novel is a stub.
