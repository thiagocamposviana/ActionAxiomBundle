["Frank Marshall King (November 28, 1883\u00a0\u2013 May 29, 1959), was a Spanish, Catalan pianist and pedagogue born to parents of English heritage.","Marshall was born in Matar\u00f3, Catalonia, Spain.  He attended the Conservatori Superior de M\u00fasica del Liceu and then began studying with Enrique Granados. Marshall and Granados became close musical associates, and Marshall became Granados's teaching assistant at the latter's academy.","When Granados died in 1916, Marshall became its director; he remained director until his death in 1959, and the institute's name was eventually changed to Acad\u00e9mia Frank Marshall. Among his pupils at the school was the composer Vicente Asencio. He published two pedagogic works, Estudio pr\u00e1ctico sobre los pedales del piano (Madrid, 1919) and La sonoridad del piano, which attempted to notate piano pedaling more precisely.","Marshall's influence as a pianist and teacher impacted Catalan piano playing heavily; his approaches to pedaling and voicing helped refine the distinctive style of piano playing from the region. His most famous student was Alicia de Larrocha.  No. 3 of Federico Mompou's Can\u00e7ons i Danses was dedicated to him.","Marshall died in Barcelona in 1959, aged 75."]
