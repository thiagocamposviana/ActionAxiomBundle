["Lee Woon-jae (Korean:\u00a0\uc774\uc6b4\uc7ac ; born 26 April 1973) is a South Korean former football goalkeeper. He was part of South Korea's 1994, 2002, 2006 and 2010 FIFA World Cup campaigns. He was, with Mark Schwarzer, one of only two Asian players to be nominated for the IFFHS World's Best Goalkeeper of the 21st Century (2001\u20132011).[3]","Lee was a part of the South Korea squad for the 1994 FIFA World Cup and was substituted into the game against Germany after starting goalkeeper Choi In-young. After the 1994 World Cup, he suffered from tuberculosis and hepatitis which made the crisis to finish his playing career. Since 1998, he recovered his health and came back to the national team for the first time in four years.[4]","Lee was selected in Guus Hiddink's squad for the 2002 FIFA World Cup as the first-choice goalkeeper after the rivalry against Kim Byung-ji. He appeared all seven matches until the third place play-off, and kept three clean sheets against Poland, Portugal and Spain in the tournament. He made South Korean football history against Spain in the quarter-final, which ended in a draw and went to penalties. Lee blocked Spain's fourth shot, taken by Joaqu\u00edn and South Korea defeated Spain 5\u20133 in the shoot-out, becoming the first Asian team ever to advance to the World Cup semi-finals.[5][6] South Korea finished fourth place in the tournament.","Lee captained South Korea at the 2007 AFC Asian Cup in place of injured Kim Nam-il. He saved a total of three shootout penalties during the tournament, two against Iran and one against Japan (they would win both matches and finish third overall). He was selected as the goalkeeper of All-Star XI, but he was suspended from the national team for a year because he sneaked out from his hotel room and went on a drinking binge in an Indonesian bar along with South Korean teammates Kim Sang-sik, Woo Sung-yong and Lee Dong-gook before the match against Bahrain.","Lee is one of two players (the other being Rigobert Song of Cameroon) to be selected for the 2010 FIFA World Cup that were also selected for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. He is one of seven players from Asia to play in four different World Cups. He played his last game for the national team in a friendly against Nigeria on 11 August 2010 in a 2\u20131 victory, subsequently retiring from international football.","Nicknamed  the \"Spider Hand\" in South Korea,[7] Lee is regarded as one of the greatest South Korean goalkeepers of all time. He didn't have height and rapid pace, but having great judgment and showing the harmonies with defenders, he was stable in front of goalpost.[7] He was also noted for his predictive ability and this made him strong on the penalty shoot-out. His winning rate was 91.7% (11 wins and 1 loss) and save percentage was 44.8% (58 times and 26 saves) in the penalties shoot-out of K League.[8]"]
