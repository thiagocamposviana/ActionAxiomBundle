["Leonard Gross (born February 24, 1931) is an American mathematician and Professor Emeritus of Mathematics at Cornell University.[1]","Gross has made fundamental contributions to mathematics and the mathematically rigorous study of quantum field theory.","Leonard Gross graduated from James Madison High School in December 1948. He was awarded an Emil Schweinberg scholarship[2] that enabled him to attend college. He studied at City College of New York for one term and then studied electrical engineering at Cooper Union for two years. He then transferred to the University of Chicago, where he obtained a Master's degree in Physics and Mathematics (1954) and a Ph. D. in Mathematics (1958).[3]","Gross taught at Yale University and was awarded a National Science Foundation Fellowship in 1959.[4] He joined the faculty of the mathematics department of Cornell University in 1960. Gross was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in 1959 and in 1983[3] and has held other visiting positions. He has supervised 35 doctoral students. [5]","Gross serves on the editorial boards of the Journal of Functional Analysis,[6] and Potential Analysis.[7]","Gross's scientific work has centered on the mathematically rigorous study of quantum field theories and related mathematical theories such as statistical mechanics. His early works developed the foundations of integration on infinite-dimensional spaces and analytic tools needed for quantum fields corresponding to classical fields described by linear equations. His later works have been devoted to Yang\u2013Mills theory and related mathematical theories such as analysis on loop groups.","Gross's earliest mathematical works[8] were on integration and  harmonic analysis on infinite-dimensional spaces. These ideas, and especially the need for a structure within which  potential theory in infinite dimensions could be studied,  culminated in Gross's construction of  abstract Wiener spaces[9] in 1965. This structure has since become a standard framework[10] for infinite-dimensional analysis.","Gross was one of the initiators of the study of logarithmic Sobolev inequalities, which he discovered in 1967 for his work in constructive quantum field theory  and published later in two foundational papers[11][12]  established these inequalities for the Bosonic and Fermionic cases. The inequalities were named by Gross, who established the inequalities in  dimension-independent form, a key feature especially in the context of applications to infinite-dimensional settings such as for quantum field theories. Gross's logarithmic Sobolev  inequalities proved to be of great significance well beyond their original intended  scope of application, for example in the proof of  the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture by Grigori Perelman.[13][14]","Gross has done important work in the study of loop groups, for example proving the Gross ergodicity theorem for the pinned Wiener measure under the action of the smooth loop group.[15] This result led to the construction of a Fock-space decomposition for the                                    L                        2                                     {\\displaystyle L^{2}}      -space of functions on a compact Lie group with respect to a heat kernel measure. This decomposition has then led to many other developments in the study of harmonic analysis on Lie groups in which the Gaussian measure on Euclidean space is replaced by a heat kernel measure.[16][17]","Yang\u2013Mills theory has been another focus of Gross's works. Since 2013, Gross and Nelia Charalambous have made a deep study of the Yang\u2013Mills heat equation[18] and related questions.","Gross was a Guggenheim Fellow in 1974-1975.[19] He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences[20] in 2004 and named a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society in the inaugural class of 2013.[21] He was recipient of the Humboldt Prize in 1996.[22]"]
