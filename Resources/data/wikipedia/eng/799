["Belle de Boskoop (also called Goudrenet, Goudreinet or Goudreinnette) is an apple cultivar which originated in Boskoop, Netherlands, where it began as a chance seedling in 1856. Variants include Boskoop red, yellow and green. This rustic apple is firm, tart and fragrant. Greenish-gray tinged with red, the apple stands up well to cooking. Generally Boskoop varieties are very high in acid content and can contain more than four times the vitamin C of Granny Smith or Golden Delicious.[1]","The apple grows well in Normandy, France.[2]","Blossoming 'Belle de Boskoop' apple tree","Ripe 'Red Boskoop' on a branch","The cultivar is compatible with most rootstocks, but its pollen quality is poor because it is a triploid. Cultivars that can provide compatible pollen for 'Belle de Boskoop' include Discovery, James Grieve, Melba and Reine des Reinettes. The apple stores well after harvest."]
