It is from the Cornish for far moor, goon + pell[1].","Goonbell is located east of the now defunct St Agnes railway station,[2] a stop on the Truro and Newquay Railway. Goonbell itself had a halt on the same line.","Coordinates: 50\u00b018\u203214\u2033N  5\u00b011\u203238\u2033W   \ufeff \/ \ufeff 50.3039225\u00b0N 5.19376\u00b0W \ufeff \/ 50.3039225; -5.19376","This Cornwall location article is a stub.
