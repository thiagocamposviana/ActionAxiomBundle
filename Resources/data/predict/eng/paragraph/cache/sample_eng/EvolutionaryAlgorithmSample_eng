these phonemes with \ud801\udc77 \u0254\u02d0 which is known as the cot caught merger in addition some american dialects merge \ud801\udc67 \u025b and \ud801\udc66 \u026a before nasal stops the pin pen merger","there is no ability to indicate word stress however in most cases the reduction of unstressed vowels is sufficient to distinguish word pairs that are distinguished only by stress in spoken discourse for instance the noun convict \u02c8k\u0252nv\u026akt and the verb convict k\u0259n\u02c8v\u026akt can be spelled \ud801\udc52\ud801\udc6a\ud801\udc6f\ud801\udc5d\ud801\udc66\ud801\udc52\ud801\udc51 and \ud801\udc52\ud801\udc69\ud801\udc6f\ud801\udc5d\ud801\udc66\ud801\udc52\ud801\udc51 respectively","additionally certain common words are abbreviated as single letters the words the \ud801\udc5e of \ud801\udc5d and \ud801\udc6f to \ud801\udc51 and often for \ud801\udc53 are written with the single letters indicated","shaw had served from to on the bbc s advisory committee on spoken english which included several exponents of phonetic writing he also knew henry sweet creator of current shorthand and a prototype for the character of henry higgins although shaw himself used the shorthand system of isaac pitman all of his interest in spelling and alphabet reform was made clear in shaw s will of june in which provision was made for isaac james pitman with a grant in aid from the public trustee to establish a shaw alphabet following shaw s death in november and after some legal dispute the trustee announced a worldwide competition to design such an alphabet with the aim of producing a system that would be an economical way of writing and of printing the english language","a contest for the design of the new alphabet was won by four people including ronald kingsley read read was then appointed to amalgamate the four designs to produce the new alphabet","due to the contestation of shaw s will the trust charged with developing the new alphabet could afford to publish only one book a version of shaw s play androcles and the lion in a bi alphabetic edition with both conventional and shavian spellings penguin books london copies were sent to major libraries in english speaking countries","between and issues of the journal shaw script were published by kingsley read in worcester u k the journal used shaw s alphabet and much of the content was submitted by shaw enthusiasts in more recent years there have been several published works of classical literature transliterated into shavian","the first released in was the works of edgar allan poe entitled poe meets shaw the shaw alphabet edition of edgar allan poe by tim browne this book was published via shaw alphabet books and had two editions in its original release one like androcles and the lion had shavian side by side with the latin equivalent and the other was a shavian only edition","the second released in was an edition of alice s adventures in wonderland transcribed into shavian by thomas thurman this was published as a shaw only edition with no side by side latin equivalent the shavian fonts were designed by michael everson","some disagreement has arisen among the shavian community in regard to sound symbol assignments which have been the topic of frequent arguments primarily this has concerned the alleged reversal of two pairs of letters citation needed","the most frequent disagreement of the letter reversals has been over the haha hung pair the most convincing evidence suggesting this reversal is in the names of the letters the unvoiced letter haha is deep while the voiced hung which suggests a lower position is tall this is often assumed to be a clerical error introduced in the rushed printing of the shavian edition of androcles and the lion citation needed this reversal obscures the system of tall letters as voiceless consonants and deep letters as voiced consonants","proponents of traditional shavian however have suggested that kingsley read may not have intended for this system to be all encompassing though it seems that vertical placement alone served this purpose in an earlier version of shavian before the rotations were introduced also read may have intentionally reversed these letters perhaps to emphasize that these letters represent unrelated sounds which happen to occur in complementary distribution","both sides of the debate have suggested other reasons including associations with various styles of latin letters namely the g in ing often written with a bottom loop in script and the effect of letter height on the coastlines of words but whether read considered any of these is uncertain since the letter representing the same sound in read s quikscript appears identical to hung it is doubtful that read reversed the letter twice by mistake he may have thought it best to leave things as they were mistake or not especially as a corrected ng might in hasty or careless writing be confused with his new letter for n in quikscript","two other letters that are often alleged to have been reversed intentionally or not are air and err both are ligatures and their relation to other letters is usually taken as evidence for this reversal citation needed","one of the beliefs that leads to such allegations is that while air \ud801\udc7a appears to be a ligature of the letters ado \ud801\udc69 and roar \ud801\udc6e it s treated as a ligature of the letters egg \ud801\udc67 and roar \ud801\udc6e one would expect the ligature of these letters to be joined at the bottom and free at the top yet the opposite is true","another such belief is that while err \ud801\udc7b appears to be a ligature of the letters egg \ud801\udc67 and roar \ud801\udc6e it s treated as a ligature of up \ud801\udc73 and roar \ud801\udc6e based on their appearance one would expect the ligature of these letters to be joined at the top and free at the bottom yet once again the opposite is true","some years after the initial publication of the shaw alphabet read expanded it to create quikscript also known as the read alphabet quikscript is intended to be more useful for handwriting and to that end is more cursive and uses more ligatures many letter forms are roughly the same in both alphabets see the separate article for more details","paul vandenbrink has created a new alphabet inspired by the shavian alphabet which takes the controversial step of replacing most of the specific vowel letters with markers indicating which of several sets of vowel types a vowel belongs to thus reducing the number of vowel distinctions and lessening the written differences between dialectal variations of english","an adaptation of shavian to another language esperanto was developed by john wesley starling though not widely used at least one booklet has been published with transliterated sample texts as that language is already spelled phonemically direct conversion from latin to shavian letters can be performed though several ligatures are added for the common combinations of vowels with n and s and some common short words","pronunciations that differ from their english values are marked in bold red","shavian was added to the unicode standard in april with the release of version","the unicode block for shavian is u u f and is in plane the supplementary multilingual plane","while the shavian alphabet was added to unicode in unicode shavian fonts are still quite rare before it was standardized fonts were made that include shavian letters in the places of roman letters and or in an agreed upon location in the unicode private use area allocated from the conscript unicode registry and now superseded by the official unicode standard","these following fonts contain full unicode support for shavian windows mac linux systems need fonts such as these to display the shavian glyphs","the riet flows about km from the vicinity of the eastern free state town of smithfield and has a confluence with the vaal river upstream from the northern cape town of douglas it flows through the kalkfontein dam water from the orange river at vanderkloof dam is fed into the riet river at jacobsdal to provide water for irrigation this has the combined effect of adding water to the river and lowering the salinity when vanderkloof dam is spilling excess water from vanderkloof dam is transferred to the kalkfontein dam","this article related to a river in south africa is a stub you

of no other one from pinkerton alex young at consequence of sound compared the song s bombastic guitar riffs and earworm hooks to pinkerton genre wise it has been described as an alt rock chugger and a power pop jam","chris deville at stereogum held the song in higher regards than the previous single thank god for girls describing it as pinkerton style meets green album quality carolyn menyes from music times stated do you wanna get high is a hard hitting song and reminds fans that for every goofy weezer song there s this sort of real rock gem and for bonus points there s a soaring guitar solo that brings the real hardness of this song all the way home at spin andrew unterberger ranked it as the th best post pinkerton weezer song observing the narcotic temptations of the lyrics give high a darkness and intrigue we never heard from cuomo the first time around thankfully keeping it from becoming cartoonish in its retro leanings","genesis archive reached no in the uk","discs one and two

the tour s dates to be recorded in multi track it is one of a collection of tracks on the box set with newly recorded vocals from gabriel and guitar parts from hackett partly due to the difficulty gabriel had as his more elaborate costumes often muffled his voice it is a re worked studio version with new vocals based on the live recording as the recording used as a source for the release had ended early due to the recorder at the concert having run out of tape however the song actually played at the show appears on the as though emerald city bootleg released in by the amazing kornyfone
